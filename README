1.  REQUIREMENTS

    Besides Python, various tools are necessary for building QM
    software and documentation.  See

      http://www.software-carpentry.com/dev

    for more information on obtaining the tools.

2.  BUILDING QM

    From the top of the source tree, first configure the sources:

      ./configure

    You'll have to do a one-time setup as well:

      make setup

    Then build things:

      make

3. GETTING STARTED WITH QMTRACK

   The qmtrack executable is qm/qm/track/qmtrack.  This single
   executable provides all QMTrack functionality.  There is no need to
   set up your PYTHONPATH; this is set automatically by the script.

   First, create a new issue database with the initialize command.
   Specify the path to the new database.  You'll want to specify the
   --test-values option too, to populate it with some dummy stuff.

     qmtrack initialize --test-values /path/to/idb

   Subsequently, you have to tell qmtrack where the IDB is.  Either
   use the --idb option, or

     export QMTRACK_IDB_PATH=/path/to/idb

   You should then be able to poke around at the IDB.  For instance,
   to list the issue ids of all issues,

     qmtrack --format iid query 1

   (The query expression "1" always evaluates to true, so all issues
   match.)  Use the --help option to learn more about using the
   qmtrack command.


   To start the web server, use the qmtrack server command.  For
   instance, to start the server on port 9000 and write log messages
   to stdout,

     qmtrack server --port 9000 --log-file -

   Point your web browser at

     http://my.host:9000/track/summary

   and click around.
