3.  BUILDING QM

    From the top of the source tree, first configure the sources:

      ./configure

    The configuration script looks for a Python interpreter executable
    in your PATH.  To specify a different interpreter, specify the
    option 

      --with-python=INTERPRETER_PATH

    To install QM in a location other than /usr/local specify the
    --prefix option to configure:

      --prefix=/path/to/install

    To build QM:

      make


  - INSTALLING QM

    To install QM:

      make install

    By default, this installs files under /usr/local; to use a different
    prefix, specify the --prefix option to configure.


  - TESTING QM

    QM comes with a test suite to verify its functioning.  Of course,
    this test suite is implemented using QMTest.  The test suite is
    located in the tests subdirectory of the source tree.  To run it,
    invoke

      qmtest -D /path/to/qm/tests run

    This assumes that the qmtest executable you just installed (or
    another one) is in your PATH, and that /path/to/qm is the path to
    your QM source tree.
