------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  REQUIREMENTS

    To run QM, you will need Python Python 2.2 (or greater).  Visit

      http://www.python.org

    to obtain source and binary distributions of Python.

    If you are using Windows, you must also install the Python Win32
    extensions.  Visit:

      http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html

    You must use GNU Make to build QM.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  LICENSE

    QM is licensed under the GNU General Public License.  See the file
    COPYING for the exact text of the license.

    The DocumentTemplate module is Copyright Zope Corporation and
    Contributors.  See:

      qm/external/DocumentTemplate/LICENSE.txt

    for the exact text of that license.

3.  BUILDING QM

    From the top of the source tree, first configure the sources:

      ./configure

    The configuration script looks for a Python interpreter executable
    in your PATH.  To specify a different interpreter, specify the
    option 

      --with-python=INTERPRETER_PATH

    To install QM in a location other than /usr/local specify the
    --prefix option to configure:

      --prefix=/path/to/install

    If you are building from CVS sources and want to build the
    documentation add:

      --enable-maintainer-mode

    If you are building from a released version, you do not need to use
    this option.

    After running configure, run:

      make

    to perform the build.  You must use GNU make, which is called
    "gmake" on some systems.

    If you are modifying QMTest, you may want to install HappyDoc 2.1
    from:

      http://sourceforge.net/projects/happydoc/

    If you install HappyDoc before you run configure, you can use:

      make doc-python
 
     to build documentation about the internals of QM.


  - TESTING QM

    QM comes with a test suite to test itself.  Of course, this test
    suite is implemented using QMTest.  To run it, invoke

      make check

    after performing building QM.


  - INSTALLING QM

    To install QM:

      make install

    By default, this command installs files under /usr/local; to use a
    different prefix, specify the --prefix option to configure.
