3.  BUILDING QM

    From the top of the source tree, first configure the sources:

      ./configure

    The configuration script looks for a Python interpreter executable
    in your PATH.  To specify a different interpreter, specify the
    option 

      --with-python=INTERPRETER_PATH

    To install QM in a location other than /usr/local specify the
    --prefix option to configure:

      --prefix=/path/to/install

    If you are building from CVS sources and want to build the
    documentation add:

      --enable-maintainer-mode

    If you are building from a released version, you do not need to use
    this option.

    After running configure, run:

      make

    to perform the build.  You must use GNU make, which is called
    "gmake" on some systems.

    If you are modifying QMTest, you may want to install HappyDoc 2.1
    from:

      http://sourceforge.net/projects/happydoc/

    If you install HappyDoc before you run configure


  - TESTING QM

    QM comes with a test suite to testitself.  Of course, this test
    suite is implemented using QMTest.  To run it, invoke

      make check

    after performing building QM.


  - INSTALLING QM

    To install QM:

      make install

    By default, this installs files under /usr/local; to use a different
    prefix, specify the --prefix option to configure.
