@ action class control
**Action Class**

The action class determines how the action is parameterized, and
provides the mechanism by which the action is run.

%(program_name)s provides a collection of built-in action classes which
you may use to create actions.  To use one of these, select it from the
*Standard Classes* list.

You may also create your own action classes.  An action class is
represented by a Python class included in a Python module.  Specify the
class in the text control, using the syntax *module-name.class-name*.

So that %(program_name)s can find the Python module file, you must
include the directory containing it in the environment variable
'QMTEST_CLASSPATH'.


@ action ID
**Action ID**

An action ID is a label that identifies an action.  Action IDs are
unique within a single test database, but are distinct from test IDs and
suite IDs.

The action ID may be composed of lower-case letters, digits, and
underscores.

You may optionally organize actions in a hierarchy using a period as the
path separator.  

Bear in mind that a test's actions are always specified relative to the
the test's path.  For example, the test with ID "core.test1" would
specify the action "core.action1" simply as "action1".


@ action popup
**Specify an Action**

Use this window to specify an action for a test.  An action specifies a
setup behavior that must be executed before the test is run, and/or a
cleanup behavior that must be executed after the test is run.  

Actions are objects distinct from tests, but they reside in the same
test database.  Each action has its own action ID.  

Select an action ID an existing action from the list, or enter an action
ID in the edit control.


@ actions control
**Actions**

The list displays the action IDs of the actions specified for this
test.  To add another action, click on *Add...*.  To remove an action,
select it in the list and click on *Remove.*.


@ category popup
**Specify a Category**

Enter the name of the category to which add the test.  You may use any
text string as the name of a category.


@ categories control
**Categories**

The list displays the names of the categories of which this test is a
member.  To add this test to another category, click on *Add...*.  To
remove this test from a category, select the category's name in the list
and click on *Remove.*.


@ prerequisite popup
**Specify a Prerequisite Test**

Use this window to specify a test prerequisite.  The prerequisite is a
test that is run first, and it must produce an expected outcome for the
prerequisite to be satisfied.  

To specify a prerequisite:

 1. In the **Test ID** field, select the test ID of the prerequisite
    test from the list, or enter it in the text control.

 2. In the **Expected Outcome** field, select the outcome that the
    prerequisite test must produce to satisfy the prerequisite.


@ prerequisites control
**Prerequisite Tests**

The list displays the current prerequisites for this test, showing the
test ID of each prerequisite test and its expected outcome.  To add
another prerequisite, click on *Add...*.  To remove a prerequisite,
select it in the list and click on *Remove*.


@ test class control
**Test Class**

The test class determines how the test is parameterized, and
provides the mechanism by which the test is run.

%(program_name)s provides a collection of built-in test classes which
you may use to create tests.  To use one of these, select it from the
*Standard Classes* list.

You may also create your own test classes.  An test class is represented
by a Python class included in a Python module.  Specify the class in the
text control using the syntax *module-name.class-name*.

So that %(program_name)s can find the Python module file, you must
include the directory containing it in the environment variable
'QMTEST_CLASSPATH'.


@ test ID 
**Test ID**

A test ID is a label that identifies a test.  Test IDs are unique within
a single test database, but are distinct from action IDs and suite IDs.

The test ID may be composed of lower-case letters, digits, and
underscores.  

You may optionally organize tests in a hierarchy using a period as the
path separator.  Paths specified this way define implicit test suites.
For example, if your test database contains tests with these three IDs

  * core.test1

  * core.test2

  * test3

%(program_name)s recognizes an implicit test suite named "core" which
contains the two tests "test1" and "test2".

In addition, a test's prerequisites and actions are always specified
relative to the test's path.  So, for instance, "core.test2" would
specify "test1" as a prerequisite, not "core.test1".  This implies that
a test cannot specify an action or prerequisite in a different path
(except in subpaths).  For example, "core.test2" cannot specify "test3"
as a prerequisite.
