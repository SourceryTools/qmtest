# This file contains templates for diagnostic messages.  This file is
# parsed by code in qm.diagnostic.
#
#   - Lines beginning with a hash mark are ignored.
#
#   - Each diagnostic begins with a line that contains an "at" sign (@)
#     and a tag used to identify the diagnostic.
#
#   - Subsequent text until the start of the next diagnostic is
#     the diagnostic template.
#
#   - Diagnostic templates may contain named-substition tokens as
#     used by the Python % operator on a string.
#
#   - Diagnostics are interpreted as structured text.
#
# Please keep diagnostics in alphabetical order by tag.
