# This file contains templates for diagnostic messages.  This file is
# parsed by code in qm.diagnostic.
#
#   - Lines beginning with a hash mark are ignored.
#
#   - Each diagnostic begins with a line that contains an "at" sign (@)
#     and a tag used to identify the diagnostic.
#
#   - Subsequent text until the start of the next diagnostic is
#     the diagnostic template.
#
#   - Diagnostic templates may contain named-substition tokens as
#     used by the Python % operator on a string.
#
#   - Diagnostics are interpreted as structured text.
#
# Please keep diagnostics in alphabetical order by tag.

@ cannot invoke remotely
The IDB is currently in use by a QMTrack server, but the command you

server.

@ create build error
Internal error in creating issue.

@ create class error syn
You must specify an issue class when creating a new issue.

@ create field error
Missing mandatory field(s) "%(field)s". You must specify all mandatory
fields when creating a new issue.

@ field not in class
There is no field "%(field_name)s" in issue class %(issue_class_name)s.

@ field set use equal
The operator = is not allowed for a set field "%(field)s". You must use
the += and -= operators for fields of set types.

@ field set use plus
The operators += and -= are not allowed for a non-set field

The issue database is currently in used by another QMTrack process.  The
command you specified cannot be performed until the issue database is no
longer in use.

@ idb locked
The IDB is currently locked by another QMTrack process.  Please try
this command again later.  

If you believe the lock file is stale and has been left behind by a
defuct QMTrack process, delete the directory '%(lock_path)s' and try
again.
