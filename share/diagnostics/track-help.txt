**Python Queries**

%(program_name)s allows you to query issues using a Python expression.
The query returns all issues for which the query expression evaluates to
a boolean true value.  In Python, these values are taken as a boolean
false value: 'None', zero, an empty string, and an empty list, tuple, or
map.  Other values are taken to be true.

%(program_name)s evaluates the query expression for each issue.  The
issue's value for each field is placed in a variable of the same name as
the same field.  Normal Python arithmetic, logical, and miscellaneous
operators are also available.  

For example, this query:

    'user == "jones" and "GUI" in categories'

matches all issues for which the last modifying user is "jones" and
which is in the category "GUI".
