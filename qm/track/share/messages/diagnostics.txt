# This file contains templates for diagnostic messages.  This file is
# parsed by code in qm.diagnostic.
#
#   - Lines beginning with a hash mark are ignored.
#
#   - Each diagnostic begins with a line that contains an "at" sign (@)
#     and a tag used to identify the diagnostic.
#
#   - Subsequent text until the start of the next diagnostic is
#     the diagnostic template.
#
#   - Diagnostic templates may contain named-substition tokens as
#     used by the Python % operator on a string.
#
#   - Diagnostics are interpreted as structured text.

# Please keep diagnostics in alphabetical order by tag.

Please retry this command once the IDB is no longer in use by the
server.

@ create build error
Internal error in creating issue.

@ create class error syn
You must specify an issue class when creating a new issue.

@ create field error
Missing mandatory field(s) "%(field)s". You must specify all mandatory
fields when creating a new issue.

@ create issue error
An issue with the iid "%(iid)s" already exists. Try a different iid.

@ field set use equal
The operator = is not allowed for a set field "%(field)s". You must use

@ idb in use
The issue database is currently in used by another QMTrack process.  The
command you specified cannot be performed until the issue database is no
longer in use.

@ idb locked
The issue database at %(idb_path)s is currently locked by another
QMTrack process.  Please try this command again later.  If you believe
the lock file is stale and has been left behind by a defuct QMTrack
process, delete the directory %(lock_path)s and try again.
