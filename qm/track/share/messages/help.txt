@ query help
**Python Queries**

%(program_name)s allows you to query issues using a Python expression.
The query returns all issues for which the query expression evaluates to
a boolean true value.  In Python, these values are taken as a boolean
false value: 'None', zero, an empty string, and an empty list, tuple, or
map.  Other values are taken to be true.

%(program_name)s evaluates the query expression for each issue.  The
issue's value for each field is placed in a variable of the same name as
the same field.  Normal Python arithmetic, logical, and miscellaneous
operators are also available.  

For example, this query:

    'user == "jones" and "GUI" in categories'

matches all issues for which the last modifying user is "jones" and
which is in the category "GUI".


@ state model help
**State Model**

%(program_name)s allows you to specify a state model for each issue
class.  The state model helps you specify and control the procedure your
organization follows for dealing with each issue.

The state model consists of a set of *states*.  Each issue is in exactly
one state at any given time.  In addition, the state model includes
*transitions* connecting the states.  Each transition leads from one
state to another state.  A user may change the state of an issue only if
the state model includes a transition from the issue's current state to
the new state.

Each state is identified by its name, which must be unique in the state
model, and can consist of lower-case letters, digits, hyphens, and
underscores.  A state can also include a more complete description,
which helps users understand what the state signifies.  Some states are
also flagged as *open states*; an issue not in an open state is
considered no longer to be under consideration.  The *initial state* is
the state assigned to all new issues.

Some typical states that might be included in a bug-tracking state model
are,

  *submitted* -- The bug has been reported, but not yet examined.

  *active* -- The bug is currently being fixed.

  *fixed* -- The bug has been fixed.

  *tested* -- The system has been tested, and the bug no longer occurs.

  *unreproducible* -- The system's developers were not able to reproduce
   the reported bug.

Each transition is identified by the names of its starting and ending
states.  In addition, a transition may also include a *condition*.  The
condition is a Python expression that is evaluated on each issue whose
state is changed according to this transition.  The change of state is
allowed only if the expression evaluates to true.

For example, using the typical states listed above, you may wish to
restrict your state model so that only testers, Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones,
may change a bug's state from *fixed* to *tested*.  To implement this,
you might specify the condition 

  'user in ["smith", "jones"]'

for that transition.  If you omit the condition, the transition is
always allowed.

**Editing the State Model**

To add a new state, enter a name and description in the text inputs, 
check or uncheck the **Open** checkbox to indicate whether this is an
open state, and click on the **Add** button.  To remove a state, select
it in the list of states and click on the **Remove** button.  Note that
when you remove a state, all transitions leading either from or two that
state are also removed.  

To adjust a state's description or change whether it is an open state,
select the state, make the changes, and click on the **Change** button.
The name of an existing state cannot be changed.

To add a new transition, select the starting and ending states from the
combo box inputs.  Optionally, specify a Python expression for the
transition condition, or leave that input empty.  Click **Add** to add
the new transition.  To remove a transition, select it in the list of
transitions and click on the **Remove** button.


@ summary display options help
**Summary Display Options**

The "Summary Display Options" dialog box allows you to control the
format of the "Issue Summary" page.  

  * With the **Show Fields** control, you may choose which issue fields
    you wish to display as columns in the "Issue Summary" page.  The
    fields listed in the "Show Fields" box are the columns in the
    summary table.  Fields that are not displayed are shown in the
    "Don't Show Fields" box.

    To add a column to the summary, select it in the "Don't Show Fields"
    box and click on the "<< Add" button.  To remove a column from the
    summary, select it in the "Show Fields" box and click on the "Remove
    >>" button.  To rearrange the order of columns, select a field in
    the "Show Fields" box and click on the "Move Up" or "Move Down"
    button.

  * If the **Open Issues** check box is selected, the issue summary
    shows only open issues.  Issues which are in a "closed" state (as
    determined in the issue class's state model) are always omitted from
    the summary.

  * The **Coloring** controls allow you to control how %(program_name)s
    shades the background colors of rows in the issue summary.  This
    coloring helps you visually to pick out important issues from the
    issue summary.

    You may choose an enumeration field for both the hue and the
    lightness of the background color.  For instance, if you choose the
    State field for the hue control, %(program_name)s chooses the
    background color for each issue according to its state.  Choose
    "None" in both controls to disable background coloring.
