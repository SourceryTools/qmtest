"""Triggers for email notification of changes to issues.

The 'Trigger' class in this module sends notification email messages
when an issue has changed.

Each trigger instance has an associated condition which specifies
whether, for a given issue update, notification should be sent.  The
condition is a Python expression, which is evaluated according to
'qm.track.issue.eval_revision_expression'.

This module includes several trigger classes, which differ in how they
determine the recipients of the notification.

  'NotifyFixedTrigger' -- The subscribers are specified in the trigger's
  configuration.  A subscriber may be specified by email address or UID.

  'NotifyByAddressFieldTrigger' -- The subscribers are extracted from a
  field containing email addresses.  The field may be a text field (at
  most one address) or a set-of-text field (arbitrarily many subscriber
  addresses).

  'NotifyByUidFieldTrigger' -- The subscribers are extracted from a field
  containing UIDs.  Notification is sent to any of those users who have
  an email address in the user database.  The field may be a UID field
  (at most one UID) or a set-of-UID field (arbitrarily many subscriber
  UIDs).
