# Main Program
########################################################################

# Find the root of the QM installation in the following way:
#
# 1. If the QM_HOME environment variable is set, its value is
#    used unconditionally.
#
# 2. Otherwise, determine the path to this script.  If $0 is
#    an absolute path, that value is used.  Otherwise, search
#    the PATH environment variable just as the shell would do.
#
#    Having located this script, iterate up through the directories
#    that contain $0 until we find a directory containing `lib/qm' or
#    file called `qm/qm.sh'.  (It is not sufficient to simply apply
#    'dirname' twice because of pathological cases like
#    `./././bin/qmtest.sh'.)  This directory is the root of the
#    installation.  In the former case, we have found an installed
#    QM; in the latter we have found a build directory where QM
#    is being developed.
#
# After determining the root of the QM installation, set the QM_HOME
# environment variable to that value.  If we have found QM in the
# build directory, set the QM_BUILD environment variable to 1.  
# Otherwise, set it to 0.
#
# Set QM_PATH to the path to this script.

# Assume that QM is not running out of the build directory.
