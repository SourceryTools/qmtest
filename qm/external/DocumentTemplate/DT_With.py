'''Nested namespace access

   The 'with' tag is used to introduce nested namespaces.

   The text enclosed in the with tag is rendered using information
   from the given variable or expression.

   For example, if the variable 'person' is bound to an object that
   has attributes 'name' and 'age', then a 'with' tag like the
   following can be used to access these attributes::

     <!--#with person-->
       <!--#var name-->,
       <!--#var age-->
     <!--#/with-->

   Eather a 'name' or an 'expr' attribute may be used to specify data.
   A 'mapping' attribute may be used to indicate that the given data
   should be treated as mapping object, rather than as an object with
   named attributes.
