# 
#    In the event that the product being advertised includes an

# 
#    Intact (re-)distributions of any official Zope release do not
#    require an external acknowledgement.
# 
# 7. Modifications are encouraged but must be packaged separately as
#    patches to official Zope releases.  Distributions that do not
#    clearly separate the patches from the original work must be clearly
#    labeled as unofficial distributions.  Modifications which do not
#    carry the name Zope may be packaged in any form, as long as they
#    conform to all of the clauses above.
