__doc__='''Conditional insertion

       Conditional insertion is performed using 'if' and 'else'
       commands.

       To include text when an object is true using the EPFS
       format, use::

          %(if name)[
               text 
          %(if name)]

       To include text when an object is true using the HTML
       format, use::

          <!--#if name-->
               text 
          <!--#/if name-->

       where 'name' is the name bound to the object.

       To include text when an object is false using the EPFS
       format, use::

          %(else name)[
               text 
          %(else name)]

       To include text when an object is false using the HTML
       format, use::

          <!--#else name-->
               text 
          <!--#/else name-->

       Finally to include text when an object is true and to
       include different text when the object is false using the
       EPFS format, use::

          %(if name)[
               true text 
          %(if name)]
          %(else name)[
               false text 
          %(else name)]

       and to include text when an object is true and to
       include different text when the object is false using the
       HTML format, use::

          <!--#if name-->
               true text 
          <!--#else name-->
               false text 
          <!--#/if name-->

       Notes:

       - if a variable is nor defined, it is considered to be false.

       - A variable if only evaluated once in an 'if' tag.  If the value
         is used inside the tag, including in enclosed tags, the
         variable is not reevaluated.
