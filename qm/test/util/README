1.  INTRODUCTION

    The subdirectories of this directory are scripts, extensions, 
    and other miscellany.

    None of these items are officially considered part of QMTest, and,
    as such are not documented in the QMTest manual.  None of these
    items are installed automatically.  Each individual file contains
    installation instructions.

    Instead, they are placed here because they were useful to some
    people, and, as such, may be useful to more.
