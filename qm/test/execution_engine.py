class ExecutionEngine:
    """A 'ExecutionEngine' executes tests.

    A 'ExecutionEngine' object handles the execution of a collection
    of tests.

    This class schedules the tests, plus the setup and cleanup of any
    resources they require, across one or more targets.

    The shedule is determined dynamically as the tests are executed
    based on which targets are idle and which are not.  Therefore, the
    testing load should be reasonably well balanced, even across a
    heterogeneous network of testing machines."""
