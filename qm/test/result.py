class Result:
    """A 'Result' describes the outcome of a test.

    A 'Result' contains two pieces of data: an outcome and a set
    of annotations.  The outcome indicates whether the test passed
    or failed.  More specifically, the outcome may be one of the
    following constants:

    'Result.PASS' -- The test passed.

    'Result.FAIL' -- The test failed.

    'Result.ERROR' -- Something went wrong in the process of trying to
    execute the test.  For example, if the Python code implementing
    the 'Run' method in the test class raised an exception, the
    outcome would be 'Result.ERROR'.

    'Result.UNTESTED' -- QMTest did not even try to run the test.
    For example, if a prerequiste was not satisfied, then this outcome
    will be used.'

    The annotations are a dictionary, mapping strings to strings.
    
    The indices should be of the form 'class.name' where 'class' is
    the name of the test class that created the annotation.  Any
    annotations created by QMTest, as opposed to the test class, will
    have indices of the form 'qmtest.name'.

    The annotation values are HTML.  When displayed in the GUI, the
    HTML is inserted directly into the result page; when the
    command-line interface is used the HTML is converted to plain
    text.
    
    Currently, QMTest recognizes the following built-in annotations:

    'Result.CAUSE' -- For results whose outcome is not 'FAIL', this
    annotation gives a brief description of why the test failed.  The
    preferred form of this message is a phrase like "Incorrect
    output." or "Exception thrown."  The message should begin with a
    capital letter and end with a period.  Most results formatters
    will display this information prominently.

    'Result.EXCEPTION' -- If an exeption was thrown during the
    test execution, a brief description of the exception.
    
    'Result.TARGET' -- This annotation indicates on which target the
    test was executed.

    'Result.TRACEBACK' -- If an exeption was thrown during the test
    execution, a representation of the traceback indicating where
    the exception was thrown.

    A 'Result' object has methods that allow it to act as a dictionary
    from annotation names to annotation values.  You can directly add
    an annotation to a 'Result' by writing code of the form
    'result[CAUSE] = "Exception thrown."'.
    
    A 'Result' object is also used to describe the outcome of
    executing either setup or cleanup phase of a 'Resource'."""
