# Please keep diagnostics in alphabetical order by tag.

@ action already exists
There is already an action with ID "%(action_id)s".

@ class not found
QMTest could not find a class named "%(class_name)s".  

@ concurrency not integer
The target concurrency "%(value)s" is not a positive integer.

@ context property cannot be deleted
The property %(property)s cannot be deleted from this context.

@ could not load extension class
The "%(class_name)s" extension class could not be loaded.

@ could not load target file
The "%(file)s" target file could not be loaded.

@ db path doesn't exist
"%(path)s" does not exist. 

@ dependency cycle
This test depends on itself, either directly or by way of other tests.

@ error loading xml resource
A problem occurred while loading the XML resource file "%(resource_id)s":
%(message)s

@ error loading xml test
A problem occurred while loading the XML test file "%(test_id)s":
%(message)s

@ execution terminated
Termination was requested before this test was executed.

@ extension class not found
The extension class '%(klass)s' could not be found.  You may need
to set the 'QMTEST_CLASS_PATH' environment variable.

@ extension class not subclass
The %(kind)s extension class "%(class_name)s" is not a subclass of
"%(base_name)s".

@ failed prerequisite
A prerequisite produced an incorrect outcome.

@ failed resource
Setup of a required resource failed.

@ file invalid pattern
The substitution pattern "%(pattern)s" is invalid: %(msg)s.  The pattern
should be a valid Python regular expression.

@ file invalid substitution
The substitution "%(substitution)s" is invalid.  A substitution should
have the form "/*pattern*/*replacement*/".

@ invalid boolean context var
The value of "%(key)s" is not a valid boolean value.  

@ invalid class
There is no test class "%(class_name)s".

@ invalid class name
The class name "%(class_name)s" is invalid.  Specify the class name in
the form 'module.class'.

@ invalid concurrency
Specify a positive integer with the '--parallel' option.

@ invalid context key
The context key "%(key)s" is not valid.  Context keys may contain
letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods.

@ invalid environment assignment
The string '%(assignment)s' is not a valid environment element.
Environment elements must have the form 'variable=value'.

@ invalid extension kind
"%(kind)s" is not an extension class kind.  The extension class kind
must be one of "test", "resource", "database", or "target".

@ invalid result
The test %(id)s of class %(test_class)s returned an invalid result,
'%(result)s'. 

@ invalid results file
%(program_name)s could not open the test results file, %(path)s.  The
problem was: %(problem)s.

@ invalid id
The name "%(id)s" is not valid.  Names may contain lower-case letters,
digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods.

@ invalid keyword assignment
The option "%(argument)s" is not valid.  This option should have the
form KEY=VALUE.

@ invalid results format
"%(format)s" is not a valid format for test results.  Possible formats are
%(valid_formats)s.

@ missing arg for template
Specify the name of the test class and the test ID of the new test.

@ missing argument
A value for the "%(title)s" parameter is missing.

@ missing context variable
The context variable "%(key)s" was not defined.

@ missing test id
There is no test with ID "%(test_id)s".

@ module does not exist
There is no module named "%(module)s" in any of the extension
directories.

QMTest searched for files named '%(module)s.py', '%(module)s.pyc', and
'%(module)s.pyo'.

You may need to set the 'QMTEST_CLASS_PATH' environment variable.

@ new db message
QMTest has created a new test database at '%(path)s'.

@ no db specified
You must specify the location of the test database.  

  * Specify the '--db-path' option with the path to the database.

  * Or, set the '%(envvar)s' environment variable to the path to the
    database. 

@ loading class
QMTest will load '%(class_name)s' from '%(file_name)s'.

@ no id for edit
You must specify the ID of the item to edit.

@ no id for show
You must specify the ID of the item to show.

@ no id for submit
You must speicfy the ID of the item to submit.

@ no results file specified

@ no shell executable
Cannot execute the shell interpreter.

@ no such action
There is no action with the action ID "%(action_id)s".

@ no such ID
There is no test or suite with ID "%(id)s".

@ no such item
There is no %(kind)s with the ID "%(item_id)s".

@ no target for group
No target which matches the group pattern specified for this test.

@ not implemented
An extension class failed to override the method "%(method_name)s".

The following traceback may be helpful to the extension class implementor.

@ test already exists
There is already a test with ID "%(test_id)s".

@ test did not raise
The test code did not raise an exception.

@ test class not fully specified
You must specify the Python path to the test class, including the
packages or modules containig the class.  

For example, for test "MyTest" in module "mymod" of package "mypack",

@ test raised non-object
The test code raised an exception that isn't an exception object
instance.  The type of the exception was '%(exc_type)s'.
