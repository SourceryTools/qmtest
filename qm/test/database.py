class Database:
    """A 'Database' stores tests, testsuites, and resources.

    A 'Database' has two primary functions:

    1. Test storage and retrieval.

       Every test has a unique name, called a "test id". When a new 
       test is created, the 'Database' is responsible for writing that
       test to permanent storage.  Later, QMTest will request the test 
       by providing the database with the test id.  The database must
       retrieve the test from permanent storage.

       QMTest does not put any restrictions on *how* tests are stored.
       The default database implementation uses XML to store tests,
       but any storage format will do.

    2. Test enumeration.

       The 'Database' can tell QMTest what tests are stored in the
       database.  QMTest uses this information in its graphical user
       interface to show the user what tests exist.
       
    A 'Database' stores testsuites and resources in addition to tests.
    The names for tests, testsuites, and resources are all "labels".  A
    label is a special kind of string that is designed to be easily
    convertible to a file name.  For more information, see the
    'qm.label' module.  The namespaces for tests, testsuites, and
    resources are all distinct.  For example, it is OK to have a test
    with the same name as a testsuite.
    
    Every 'Database' is associated with a particular directory on the
    local machine.  In most cases, the 'Database' will store all the
    files it needs within this directory.

    Every 'Database' has an associated 'AttachmentStore'.  An
    'AttachmentStore' is responsible for storing the attachments
    associated with tests.  See the module 'qm.attachment' for more
    information about 'AttachmentStore'.

    'Database' is an abstract class.

    You can extend QMTest by providing your own database implementation.
    One reason to do this is that you may want to store tests in a
    format different from the XML format that QMTest uses by default.
    For example, if you are testing a compiler, you might want to
    represent each test as a source file.  Or, if you are testing a
    SQL database, you might want to represent each test as two files:
    one containing SQL commands to run the test, and one containing
    the output you expect.

    Another reason to provide your own database implementation is that
    you might want to store tests on a remote location.  For example,
    suppose you wanted to allow multiple users to access the same 
    central test database.  You could create a test database that
    created and retrieved tests by communicating with the central
    server.

    To create your own database implementation, you must create a Python
    class derived (directly or indirectly) from 'Database'.  The
    documentation for each method of 'Database' indicates whether you
    must override it in your database implementation.  Some methods may
    be overridden, but do not need to be.  You might want to override
    such a method to provide a more efficient implementation, but QMTest
    will work fine if you just use the default version.

    If QMTest calls a method on a database and that method raises an
    exception that is not caught within the method itself, QMTest will
    catch the exception and continue processing.  Therefore, methods
    here only have to handle exceptions themselves if that is necessary
    to maintain the integrity of the database.

    A single 'Database' may be accessed by multiple threads
    simultaneously.  Therefore, you must take appropriate steps to
    ensure thread-safe access to shared data."""
