    A 'ResultStream' is responsible for displaying test results for
    the user as they arrive.  It may also display summary information
    when the results are complete.  The 'ResultStream' may also
    choose to write the results to a file for permanent storage.

    'ResultStream' is an abstract class.
    
    QMTest does not presently have a mechanism for extension in this
    area.  However, in a future release of QMTest, you will be able to
    define your own 'ResultStream'.  A typical reason to extend
    'ResultStream' would be to write out test results in alternative
