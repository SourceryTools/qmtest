    """Base class for target implementations.

    A 'Target' is an entity that can run tests.  QMTest can spread the
    workload from multiple tests across multiple targets.  In
    addition, a single target can run more that one test at once.

    'Target' is an abstract class.

    You can extend QMTest by providing your own target class
    implementation.

    To create your own test class, you must create a Python class
    derived (directly or indirectly) from 'Target'.  The documentation
    for each method of 'Target' indicates whether you must override it
    in your test class implementation.  Some methods may be
    overridden, but do not need to be.  You might want to override
    such a method to provide a more efficient implementation, but
    QMTest will work fine if you just use the default version."""
