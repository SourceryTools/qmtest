<chapter id="chap-test-tour">
 <title>Getting Started with &qmtest;</title>
 
  <para>QMTest is an general-purpose, cross-platform software testing
  tool.  QMTest can be used to test compilers, databases, graphical
  user interfaces, or embedded systems.  QMTest provides a convenient
  graphical user interface for creating, managing, and executing
  tests, provides support for parallel test execution, and can be
  extended in a variety of ways.</para>

  <para>This chapter will show you how to use &qmtest; by example.
  You will learn how to use &qmtest; to create tests, run tests, and
  examine the results.</para>

  <section id="sec-testtut-setting-up">
   <title>Setting Up</title>

   <para>A test database is a directory that &qmtest; uses to store
   tests.  If you want to create a new, empty test database from
   scratch, you use the <command>&qmtest-cmd;
   create-tdb</command> command, but for this tutorial, you should use
   the sample test database provided with &qmtest;.  Since you'll
   modify the test database later in the tutorial, start by making a
   copy of it.  Copy the entire test database directory tree to
   another location.  If you've installed &qmtest; in the default
   location you can make a copy of the sample database by running this
   command on a UNIX system:
    <screen>
     &prompt;<userinput>cp -r /usr/local/share/qm/tutorial/test/tdb tdb</userinput>
    </screen>
   On a Windows system, use this command at a DOS 
     <footnote><para>Under Windows, you must use the standard Windows
     command shell (DOS) to run &qmtest;; alternative shells (such as Cygwin)
     will not work with &qmtest;.</para></footnote>
   prompt:
    <screen>
     &prompt;<userinput>xcopy c:\progra~1\qm\share\qm\tutorial\test\tdb tdb\ /s</userinput>
    </screen>
   If you installed &qmtest; in another directory,
   substitute that directory for <filename>/usr/local</filename> or
   <filename>c:\progra~1\qm</filename> in the commands above.</para>

   <para>Then, enter the new directory you have created.  On both UNIX
   and Windows systems, you can do this with this command:
    <screen>
     &prompt;<userinput>cd tdb</userinput>
    </screen>
   </para>

   <para>Make sure that &qmtest; is in your <envar>PATH</envar> so
   that the operating system can find it.  On UNIX, you can use this
   command:
    <screen>
     &prompt;<userinput>PATH=/usr/local/bin:${PATH}; export PATH</userinput>
    </screen>
   in the Bourne shell.  In the C shell, use:
    <screen>
     &prompt;<userinput>setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:${PATH}</userinput>
    </screen>
   On Windows, use:
    <screen>
     &prompt;<userinput>PATH C:\progra~1\qm\bin;%PATH%</userinput>
    </screen>
   In order to avoid having to retype these commands every time you
   want to use &qmtest;, you can set up your system so that these
   commands are executed automatically when you log in.  Consult your
   system's manuals to find out how to do this.
   </para>

  <section id="sec-testtut-gui">
   <title>Starting the Graphical Interface</title>

   <para>To examine the tests in the test database, you can use
   &qmtest;'s graphical user interface.  To start the graphical user
   interface, use the <command>qmtest gui</command> command, like
   this: 

   <screen>
&prompt;<userinput>qmtest gui</userinput>
   </screen>

   You will see output similar to:

   <screen><computeroutput><![CDATA[
QMTest running at http://127.0.0.1:1158/test/dir
]]></computeroutput></screen>
   </para>

   <para>After a moment, a new web browser window will open, and you
   will see the &qmtest; graphical user interface (GUI).  If a web
   browser window does not open, you will have to manually enter the
   URL that &qmtest; printed out
   (<literal>http://127.0.0.1:1158/test/dir</literal> in the example
   above) into your browser.  Alterantively, you can edit your <link
   linkend="chap-common-manual">QM configuration file</link> to tell
   QM how to invoke your browser and then start the GUI again.</para>

   <para>The page you see in your browser shows the contents of the
   test database.  You can see that there are three tests in the
   database, named <filename>exec0</filename>, <filename>exec1</filename>,
   and <filename>exec2</filename>.  You can always click on the
   <guilabel>Home</guilabel> link in the upper-right corner to
   return to this page.</para>
     
   <para>&qmtest; creates a traditional graphical user interface using
   your web browser.  The black bar across the top of the browser
   window is &qmtest;'s menu bar.</para>

  </section><!-- sec-testtut-gui -->

  <section id="sec-testtut-running-tests">
   <title>Running Tests</title>

   <para>To run all the tests, choose <guibutton>All Tests</guibutton>
   from the <guilabel>Run</guilabel> menu.  &qmtest; will immediately
   display the test results page.  As the tests run, this page will be
   automatically updated.  (If you do not want to wait for QMTest to
   update the page, you can manually reload the page in your browser.)
   After a few moments, &qmtest; will display the test results for the
   three tests in the database.  The upper part of the screen gives a
   statistical overview of the test results.  Of the three tests, two
   passed.  However, one test failed.  You can use this statistical
   information to get a quick overview of your application's
   correctness.</para>

   <para>In addition to showing you how many tests passed and how
   many failed, &qmtest; shows you whether how many tests had
   <emphasis>unexpected</emphasis> pass or fail outcomes.  If you 
   know that certain tests will fail, you can tell &qmtest; that they 
   are expected to fail.  Then, if you are testing a change to
   your application, you can easily see whether your change made
   things better or worse.  As long as there are no unexpected
   failures, your change did not cause any problems.</para>

   <para>If you have not explicitly set up an expectation for a test,
   &qmtest; assumes that the test is expected to pass.  That is why 
   &qmtest; indicated that there was one unexpected failure when you
   ran the tests.</para>

   <para>Below the statistics section, &qmtest; displays detailed
   information about each test.  The tests that have unexpected 
   results are always displayed at the top of the list.  In this case,
   you can see that the <filename>exec1</filename> test is the one
   that is failing.</para>

  </section> <!-- sec-testtut-running-tests -->

  <section id="sec-testtut-expectations">
   <title>Setting Expectations</title>

   <para>The easiest way to create expectations is to tell &qmtest;
   that you expect future results to be the same as the results you
   just obtained.  Save the results of your test run by choosing
   <guibutton>Save Results</guibutton> from the
   <guilabel>File</guilabel> menu.  &qmtest; will prompt you for a
   file to use to store the results of your test run.  If you exit
   &qmtest;, you can reload this file to recover your test results
   without rerunning the tests.</para>

   <para>You can also use this file to set &qmtest;'s expectations.
   Choose <guibutton>Load Expectations</guibutton> from the
   <guilabel>File</guilabel> menu and provide the same file name that
   you used when you told &qmtest; when you asked it to save your
   results earlier.</para>
   
   <para>Then, &qmtest; will display a page allowing you to edit the
   expectations.  You will see a list of the tests in the database,
   together with their current expectations.  You can see that
   <filename>exec1</filename> is expected to fail; the other tests are
   expected to pass.  Now, rerun your tests by choosing <guibutton>All
   Tests</guibutton> from the <guilabel>Run</guilabel> menu.  Now, you
   will see that there are no unexpected failures; the current results
   match your expectations.</para>

   <para>You can also manually edit expectations.  Choose
   <guibutton>Edit Expectations</guibutton> from the
   <guilabel>Edit</guilabel> menu.  &qmtest; displays a list of all
   the tests.  Set the expectation for <filename>exec1</filename> back
   to <literal>PASS</literal>, click the <guibutton>OK</guibutton>
   button and rerun the tests.  You will see that now the
   <filename>exec1</filename> failure is unexpected again.  You can
   save your expectations by choosing <guibutton>Save
   Expectations</guibutton> from the <guilabel>File</guilabel>
   menu.</para>

  </section>

  <section id="sec-testtut-examining">
   <title>Examining Tests</title>
   
   <para>Click on the <filename>exec1</filename> label to examine the
   failing test.  &qmtest; will display information about the test.
   The most important information about the test is its
   <firstterm>test class</firstterm>.  This test is an instance of the
   <classname>python.ExecTest</classname> class.  The test class
   indicates what kind of test <filename>exec1</filename> is.
   &qmtest; gives a brief description of the test class in the GUI; a
   <classname>python.ExecTest</classname> checks that a Python
   expression evaluates to true.</para>

   <para>For more details about the test class, you can click on the
   <guilabel>Help</guilabel> link to the right of the description.
   &qmtest; will pop up a window that describes the test in more
   detail.  In summary, a <classname>python.ExecTest</classname>
   executes some setup code.  Then, a Python expression is evaluated.
   If the expression evaluates to true, the test passes; otherwise, it
   fails.</para>

   <para>The setup code and the expression are the
   <firstterm>arguments</firstterm> to the test class.  Every test
   class takes arguments; the arguments are what differentiate one
   instance of a test class from another.  &qmtest; displays the
   arguments for the <filename>exec1</filename> test in the GUI.  In
   this case, the sequence of statements is simply the single
   statement <literal>x = 2</literal>, which assigns
   <literal>2</literal> to the variable <varname>x</varname>.  The
   expression is <literal>x + x == 5</literal>, which compares
   <literal>x + x</literal> with <literal>5</literal>.  Since
   <varname>x</varname> is <literal>2</literal> in this case, this
   expression evaluates to false.  That is why the test fails.</para>

   <para>You can click on the <guilabel>Help</guilabel> link next to
   each argument to get more details about exactly what the argument
   is for.</para>

  </section> <!-- sec-testtut-examining -->

  <section id="sec-testtut-modifying">
   <title>Modifying and Creating Tests</title>

   <para>To fix the test, you need to change the arguments to the
   test.  Select <guibutton>Edit Test</guibutton> from the
   <guilabel>Edit</guilabel> menu.  &qmtest; will display a form that
   allows you to change the arguments to the test.</para>

   <para>Change the second argument, labeled "Python Expression," to
   <literal>x + x == 4</literal>.  Then click on the
   <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button at the bottom of the page to save
   your changes.  Choose <guibutton>This Test</guibutton> from the
   <guibutton>Run</guibutton> menu and observe that the test now
   passes.</para>

   <para>Creating in a new test works in a similar way.  Click on the
   <guilabel>Home</guilabel> link to return to the main &qmtest; page.
   Then, select <guibutton>New Test</guibutton> from the
   <guilabel>File</guilabel> menu to create a new test.  &qmtest;
   displays a form that contains two fields: the test name, and the
   test class.  The test name identifies the test; the test class
   indicates what kind of test will be created.</para>

   <para>Test names must be composed entirely of lowercase letters,
   numbers, the <quote>_</quote> character, and the <quote>.</quote>
   character.  You can think of test names like file names.  The
   <quote>.</quote> character takes the place of <quote>/</quote> on
   UNIX or <quote>\</quote> on Windows; it allows you to place a test
   in a particular <firstterm>directory</firstterm>.  For example, the
   test name <filename>a.b.c</filename> names a test named
   <filename>c</filename> in the directory <filename>a.b</filename>.
   The directory <filename>a.b</filename> is a subdirectory of the
   directory <filename>a</filename>.  By organizing your tests in
   directories, you will make it easier to keep track of your tests.
   In addition, &qmtest; can automatically run all the tests in a
   particular directory, so by using directories you will make it easy
   to run a group of related tests at once.</para>

   <para>Enter <filename>command.test1</filename> for the test name.
   This will create a new test named <filename>test1</filename> in the
   <filename>command</filename> directory.  Choose
   <classname>command.ExecTest</classname> as the test class.  This
   kind of test runs a command and compares its actual output against
   the expected output.  If they match, the test passes.  This test
   class is useful for testing many programs.  Click on the
   <guibutton>Next</guibutton> button to continue.</para>
   
   <para>Now, &qmtest; will present you with a form that looks just
   like the form you used to edit <filename>exec1</filename>, except
   that the arguments are different.  The arguments are different
   because you're creating a different kind of test.  Enter
   <literal>echo</literal> in the <guilabel>Program</guilabel> field.
   Click on the <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button to add a program
   argument and enter <literal>test</literal> in the popup dialog box.
   At this point, you've told qmtest that you want to run the command
   <command>echo test</command>.  This command will produce an output
   (the word <literal>test</literal>) as output, so find the
   <guilabel>Standard Output</guilabel> box and enter
   <literal>test</literal> in this box.  Make sure to hit the
   <keycap>Return</keycap> key after you type <literal>test</literal>;
   the <command>echo</command> command will output a carriage return
   after it prints the word <literal>test</literal>, so you must
   indicate that you expect a carriage return.  When you are done,
   click the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button at the bottom of the
   form.</para>

   <para>Now you can select <guibutton>This Test</guibutton> from the
   <guilabel>Run</guilabel> menu to run the test.</para>

   <para>When you're done experimenting with &qmtest, choose
   <guibutton>Exit</guibutton> from the <guilabel>File</guilabel>
   menu.</para>

  </section> <!-- sec-testtut-modifying -->

  <section id="sec-testtut-cmdline">
   <title>Using the Command-Line Interface</title>

   <para>All of &qmtest;'s functionality is available from the
   command-line, as well as in the graphical user interface.  When you
   invoke &qmtest-cmd; on the command line, you specify a command
   argument, which tells the program which action to perform.  Some
   commands require additional options and arguments, which you place
   after the command.  There are a few options that apply to all
   commands; to use these options place them before the command name.
   For example, in the command:

   <screen>
    &prompt;<userinput>qmtest -D . run -f full exec1</userinput>
   </screen>

   the <option>-D .</option> option is a general &qmtest-cmd;
   option, <command>run</command> is the &qmtest; command, the
   <option>-f full</option> applies to the <command>run</command>
   command, and <filename>exec1</filename> is an argument to the run
   command.  This command tests &qmtest; to run the
   <filename>exec1</filename> test from the test database in
   <filename>tdb</filename>, and to use the <option>full</option>
   format when displaying the results.</para>
                        
   <para>To see a list of available commands, and general options to
   &qmtest-cmd;, invoke it with the <option>&dashdash;help</option> (or
   <option>-h</option>) option.  To see a description of each command,
   and additional options specific to that command, invoke
   <command>qmtest <replaceable>command</replaceable>
   &dashdash;help</command>.</para>

   <para>By this point, you have modified the test database using the
   GUI and have fixed the failing test.  Recreate the original
   database now by removing and recreating the <filename>tdb</filename>
   directory.  On a UNIX system use these commands:
    <screen>
     &prompt;<userinput>cd ..</userinput>
     &prompt;<userinput>rm -rf tdb</userinput>
     &prompt;<userinput>cp -r /usr/local/share/qm/tutorial/test/tdb tdb</userinput>
     &prompt;<userinput>cd tdb</userinput>
    </screen>
   On a Windows system, use these commands instead:
    <screen>
     &prompt;<userinput>cd ..</userinput>
     &prompt;<userinput>rmdir /s tdb</userinput>
     &prompt;<userinput>xcopy c:\progra~1\qm\share\qm\tutorial\test\tdb tdb\ /s</userinput>
     &prompt;<userinput>cd tdb</userinput>
    </screen>
   </para>

   <para>The command for running tests is <command>&qmtest-cmd;
   run</command>.  Assuming you made a copy of the example test
   database as described in the previous section, execute the
   following command to run all the tests in the database:</para>

   <screen>
&prompt;<userinput>qmtest run</userinput>
   </screen>

   <para>&qmtest; runs the tests, and prints a summary of the test
   run:</para>

   <para>&qmtest; shows you the result of the tests as they execute.

  <section id="sec-testtut-expected-outcomes">
   <title>Expectations on the Command Line</title>

   <para>When you run &qmtest; on the command line, it automatically
   creates a results file called <filename>results.qmr</filename>.

   <para>The detailed information indicates what went wrong.  The test
   value was <literal>0</literal> which is considered false by Python.
   The information displayed by the <quote>full</quote> format is
   domain-dependent; it depends on the kind of application you are
   testing.  The tests in the sample database test basic functionality
   of the Python interpreter, so the full report contains information
   about Python concepts called exceptions and tracebacks.  If you
   were testing a different application, the full report would contain
   different information.  For example, if you were testing a
   database, the detailed results might refer to queries and
   records.</para>
