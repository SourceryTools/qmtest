    """An 'Executable' is a program that the operating system can run.

    'Exectuable' (and classes derived from it) create child processes.
    The 'Spawn' function creates child processes that execute
    asynchronously.  The 'Run' function creates child processes that
    execute synchrounously, i.e,. the 'Run' function does not return
    until the child process has completed its execution.

    It is safe to reuse a particular 'Executable' instance (by calling
    'Spawn' or 'Run' more than once), so long as the uses are not
    interleaved."""

        to the executable.  The first argument provided in this
        sequence will be 'argv[0]'; that is also the value used for
        the path to the executable.

        'environment' -- If not 'None', a dictionary giving the
        environment that should be provided to the child.

        'dir' -- If not 'None', the directory in which the child
        should begin execution.  If 'None', the child will execute in
        the same directory as the parent.

        'path' -- If not 'None', the path to the program to run.  If
        'None', 'arguments[0]' is used.

        'exception_pipe' -- If not 'None', a pipe that the child can
        use to communicate an exception to the parent.  This pipe is
        only used on UNIX systems.  The write end of the pipe will be
        closed by this function.

        Before creating the child, the parent will call
        'self._InitializeParent'.  On UNIX systems, the child will

        On non-UNIX systems, 'self._InitializeChild' will never be
        called.

        After creating the child, 'self._HandleChild' is called in the
        parent.  This hook should be used to handle tasks that must be
        performed after the child is running.

        separator characters, it is not modified.  Otherwise the path
