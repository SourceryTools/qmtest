  Zope 2.11.3 (unreleased)

    Bugs Fixed
  
  Zope 2.11.2 (2008/10/24) 

    Bugs Fixed

      - Ensure that response header values cannot embed CRLF pairs, which
        violate the HTTP spec (RFC 2616).

      - Launchpad #282677: fixed implementation of guarded_map and
        provided tests and implementation for guarded_zip (RestrictedPython).

      - updated to ZODB 3.8.1

      - Lauchpad #143736,#271395: fixed AttributeError' on _ltid in TempStorage

      - 'AccessControl.ZopeGuards.guarded_import' mapped some Unauthorized
        exceptions onto ImportErrors:  don't do that!  Also, removed
        mutable defaults from argument list, improved tests.

      - LP #281156:  'AccessControl.SecurityInfo.secureModule' dropped
        ModuleSecurity for failed imports, obscuring later attempts to
        import the same broken module.

      - DateTime conversion of datetime objects with non-pytz tzinfo. 
        Timezones() returns a copy of the timezone list (allows tests to run).
        (Backport of r89373 from trunk).

      - LP #253362: better dealing with malformed HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET headers

      - integrated Hotfix-2008-08-12

      - Launchpad #267545: DateTime(DateTime()) now preserves the
        correct hour

      - Launchpad #262313: respect the 'Expand macros when editing' flag
        when editing a page template through the ZMI

      - Testing.ZopeTestCase: installPackage was tied to the ZopeLite layer.

  Zope 2.11.1 (2008/07/17)

    Bugs Fixed

      - Suppressed DeprecationWarning during import of ZPublisher.Iterators:
        that module needs to use Z2-style interfaces in 2.11, for BBB, but
        the Interface module itself issues the warning on import.

      - Launchpad #246748: added 'immediate' option to sendXXX() methods
        for sending a mail immediately by-passing the zope.sendmail delivery
        mechanism
    
      - Launchpad #246290: fixed backward compatibility issue

      - zope.testing : updated to 3.5.3

      - Launchpad #245649:  the Products package is now a proper
        "namespace package" under the rules specified by setuptools.

      - zope.viewlets: updated to 3.4.2

      - zope.sendmail: updated to 3.5.0 (fixing Launchpad #230831)

      - Launchpad #239636:  Ensure that HEAD requests lock an empty body
        for NotFound errors.

      - fixed outdated transaction.commit(1) call in 
        ZODBMountPoint.SimpleTrailblazer

  Zope 2.11.0 (2008/06/15)

    Restructuring

      - Noted long-standing but silent deprecation of Zope2-style
        interfaces (on import of the Interface package).  That package
        is already gone on the trunk.

    Bugs Fixed

      - Launchpad #229549:  Don't ignore 'debug' flag when rendering
        page templates (thanks to Eric Steele for the patch).

      - Fixed against-the-rules zope.conf option 'fast_listen' to read
        'fast-listen' (dash, not underscore).

  Zope 2.11 rc 1 (2008/05/08)

    Bugs Fixed

      - Launchpad #142350: Display description for properties as row title,
        if present.

      - Launchpad #200007: DateTime(anotherDateTime) now preserves the
        timezone.

      - Launchpad #213311:  Handle "unsubscriptable object" errors
        during publishing traversal.

      - Products.Five: Fixed vocabulary lookup broken in 2.11 beta 1.
        ZopeVocabularyRegistry wasn't hooked up on startup.

      - Launchpad #143813: zopectl now exits non-zero when
        child processes fail.

      - Products.Five: Resynced browser.adding with zope.app.container.
        This fixes some minor bugs and removes deprecated code.

      - Launchpad #173658:  Removed dead code in OFS.Traversable's
        'unrestrictedTraverse' (apparent NameError).

      - Launchpad #198274:  "empty" ZopePageTemplates could not be
        unpickled.

  Zope 2.11 beta 1 (2007/12/29)

    Restructuring

      - Turned deprecation warnings for manage_afterAdd, manage_beforeDelete
        and manage_afterClone methods into discouraged warnings. These methods
        will not be removed in Zope 2.11, but stay for the foreseeable future.
        Using events is still highly encouraged.

      - Moved two implements declarations from Five into the proper classes.

      - Document.sequence: replaced by zope.sequencesort

      - All Products folders as well as the zope and zope.app folders are
        declared as setuptools namespace packages now. See
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#namespace-packages
        for more information about namespace packages.

      - ZPT: removed display of ZPT warnings since warnings were
        removed from the zope.pagetemplate implementation     

      - Ship Zope with a standard docutils 0.4 distribution, instead
        of a patched one.  Both trusted and untrusted code are still
        protected against unwanted file inclusion.

      - Removed ZGadflyDA (deprecated since Zope 2.9). The code is
        still available from svn.zope.org/Products.ZGadflyDA.

      - Removed OFS.content_types (deprecated since Zope 2.9)

      - Undeprecated 'zLOG', which will remain a backward-compatibility
        shim for the Python logging module.

      - Indexes: Removed unused parameters from '_apply_index' methods.

      - Removed deprecated support for product initialization based on
        '__ac_permissions__' and 'meta_types' attributes.

      - reStructuredText/ZReST: setting raw_enabled to 0 for security
        reasons

      - OFS Image: Image and File updated to use isinstance(data, str)
        and raises TypeError upon encountering unicode objects.

      - OFS Application: Updated deprecation warnings.
        Support for '__ac_permissions__' and 'meta_types' will be removed in
        Zope 2.11, 'methods' support might remain longer.

    Features added

      - Zope2 startup: Zope will now sends DatabaseOpened and
        ProcessStarting events during startup

      - Testing.ZopeTestCase: Introduced a "ZopeLite" test layer, making it
        possible to mix ZTC and non-ZTC tests much more freely.

      - Testing/custom_zodb.py: added support use a different storage other
        than DemoStorage. A dedicated FileStorage can be mount by setting the
        $TEST_FILESTORAGE environment variable to a custom Data.fs file.  A 
        ZEO server can be configured using the $TEST_ZEO_HOST and 
        $TEST_ZEO_PORT environment variables. This new functionality allows us
        to use the standard Zope testrunner for writing and running tests
        against existing Zope installations.

      - The ZPublisher HTTP request has now both the debug and locale
        attributes available, like its Zope 3 counterpart. The debug attribute
        was so far limited to code from the zope.* namespace in order to make
        the Zope 3 ZPT engine work. The locale attribute provides access to an
        zope.i18n.interfaces.locales.ILocale object with access to locale
        related information like date / time formatting or translated language
        and country names. Form variables of both debug and locale will shadow
        these two attributes and their use is therefor discouraged.

      - MailHost: now uses zope.sendmail for delivering the mail. With this
        change MailHost integrates with the Zope transaction system (avoids
        sending dupe emails in case of conflict errors). In addition MailHost
        now provides support for asynchronous mail delivery. The 'Use queue'
        configuration option will create a mail queue on the filesystem (under
        'Queue directory') and start a queue thread that checks the queue
        every three seconds. This decouples the sending of mail from its
        delivery.  In addition MailHosts now supports encrypted connections
        through TLS/SSL.

      - integrated ZODB 3.8 (featuring BLOB support)
    
      - integrated latest Zope3 components (aka Zope 3.4)

      - Support for using zopectl on Windows has been added. All commands are
        supported and there are two Windows specific ones: install and remove,
        which install or remove the Windows service. The start, stop and
        restart commands handle the Windows service. In order to use them, you
        need to call 'bin\zopectl install' once.

      - ZCatalog result objects (catalog brains) now have an interface,
        ZCatalog.interfaces.ICatalogBrain.

      - A new module, AccessControl.requestmethod, provides a decorator
        factory that limits decorated methods to one request method only.
        For example, marking a method with @requestmethod('POST') limits
        that method to POST requests only when published. Several
        security-related methods have been limited to POST only.

      - PythonScripts: allow usage of Python's 'sets' module

      - added 'fast_listen' directive to http-server and webdav-source-server
        sections in etc/zope.conf in order to defer the opening of the sockets
        until the late startup phase. This in in particular useful when running
        Zope behind a loadbalancer (patch by Patrick Gerken).

      - the ZopePageTemplate implementation now uses unicode internally.
        Non-unicode instances are migrated on-the-fly to unicode. However this
        will work only properly for ZPT instances formerly encoded as utf-8 or
        ISO-8859-15. For other encodings you might set the environment variable
        ZPT_REFERRED_ENCODING to insert your preferred encoding in front of
        utf-8 and ISO-8859-15 within the encoding sniffer code.

        In addition there is a new 'output_encodings' property that controls
        the conversion from/to unicode for WebDAV/FTP operations.

      - the ZPT implementation has now a configurable option in order how to
        deal with UnicodeDecodeErrors. A custom UnicodeEncodingConflictResolver
        can be configured through ZCML (see
        Products/PageTemplates/(configure.zcml, unicodeconflictresolver.py,
        interfaces.py)

      - AccessControl.Role: added new method
        manage_getUserRolesAndPermissions().

      - AccessControl: the form behind the "Security" tab has a new form
        for user-related reporting of permissions and roles

      - Zope 3-based exception views can now be registered in ZCML for
        various exceptions that can be raised by Zope. Registering an
        exception view can be done like this::

          <browser:page
            for="zope.publisher.interfaces.INotFound"
            class=".view.SomeView"
            name="index.html"
            permission="zope.Public" />

        Relevant exceptions that can have views are:

        o zope.interface.common.interfaces.IException

        o zope.publisher.interfaces.INotFound

        o zope.security.interfaces.IForbidden

        o zope.security.interfaces.IUnauthorized

        Note that the name has to be 'index.html' for the exception
        view to work. (patch by Sidnei da Silva from Enfold,
        integration by Martijn Faassen (Startifact) for Infrae)

      - DateTime now uses pytz for time zone data. This means support
        for more time zones and up to date daylight saving time
        information.

    Bugs Fixed

      - Collector #2113:  'zopectl test' masked Ctrl-C.

      - Collector #2190: Calls to zope.security.management.checkPermission
        weren't rerouted to Zope 2's security policy.

        NOTE: If you already have a Zope 2.10 instance running, you
        will either have to recreate it or add the following lines to
        the end of the etc/site.zcml file::

          <securityPolicy
                component="Products.Five.security.FiveSecurityPolicy" />

      - Collector #2223: Evaluation of booleans in TALES and the
        'default' variable.

      - Collector #2213: Can't edit "old" ZopePageTemplate instances.

      - Collector #2235: A number of ZCatalog methods were doing boolean
        evaluation of objects that implemented __len__ instead of checking
        them against None. Replaced a number of "if not obj" with
        "if obj is None".
