  <abstract>
  <para><application>QMTest</application> is a testing tool. You can use
  <application>QMTest</application> to test a software application, such as a
  database, compiler, or web browser. You can even
  <application>QMTest</application> to test a physical system (like a valve or
  thermometer) if you have a way of connecting it to your computer.</para>

  <para>Code that has not been tested adequately generally does not work. Yet,
  many applications are deployed without adequate testing, often with
  catastrophic results. It is much more costly to find defects at the end of
  the release cycle than at the beginning. By making it easy to develop tests,
  and execute those tests to validate the application,
  <application>QMTest</application> makes it easy to find problems easier,
  rather than later.</para>

  <para><application>QMTest</application> can be extended to handle any
  application domain and any test format. <application>QMTest</application>
  works with existing testsuites, no matter how they work or how they are
  stored. <application>QMTest</application>'s open and pluggable architecture
  supports a wide variety of applications.</para>

  <para><application>QMTest</application> features both an intuitive graphical
  user interface and a conventional command-line interface.
  <application>QMTest</application> can run tests in serial, in parallel on a
  single machine, or across a farm of possibly heterogeneous machines.</para>

  <para>CodeSourcery provides support for <application>QMTest</application>.
  CodeSourcery can help you install, integrate, and customize
  <application>QMTest</application>. For more information, visit <ulink
  url="http://www.qmtest.com">the QMTest web site</ulink>.</para>
