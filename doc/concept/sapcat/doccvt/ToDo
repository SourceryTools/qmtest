* Parser

** Internal links

We need a way to specify internal hyperlinks, like the label/ref of
LaTeX.  We should be able to specify labels in headings.

** Defined, definition

Somehow make sure the "first" links are off after a definition.

With abbreviations, it is convenient to have dfnref items.  But it is
also convenient if that abbreviation can be used when the term is
defined.  If we wrap a dfnref item in a dfn, we should turn off the
referencing.

Support forward referencing.

Instead of dfnref, just use ref.  The wrapping we need to implement
(above) can be generalized; don't generate a ref for a key that is
being defined.

** "First" links

They are messed up in footnotes, since "firstness" is determined in
the unit in which the footnote is created.  But it really needs to be
relative to the footnote page!  (What about LaTeX, where they are at
the bottom of the page?)



** Footnotes with hyperlinks

We might want to supply a footnote with the URL of a link, even if we
can provide the link itself.  Probably we only want to do this the
first time we encounter the link.  Ideally, when we print the
document, we provide footnotes.

** Changing header levels

We need to be able to change the levels of headers when including
documents.

** Chapter, Section

Give alternate ways to specify headers.  I think we need to be able to
get the heading "name" as words, to be inserted in various places,
where those words can change if the heading levels change.  Ideally
this would be a "style".

** Images

We should provide image conversions, e.g., dia->png.

We need to get the size of the image somehow, and insert that
information into the generated HTML.



* Prior Art

Make sure we give a sense of usefulness to both the developer and the
installer.
