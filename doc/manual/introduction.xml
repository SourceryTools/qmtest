 <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>&qmtest; is a testing tool.  You can use &qmtest; to test a
  software application, such as a database, compiler, or web browser.
  You can even &qmtest; to test a physical system (like a valve or
  thermometer) if you have a way of connecting it to your
  computer.</para>

  <para>Code that has not been tested adequately generally does not
  work.  Yet, many applications are deployed without adequate testing,
  often with catastrophic results.  It is much more costly to find
  defects at the end of the release cycle than at the beginning.  By
  making it easy to develop tests, and execute those tests to validate
  the application, &qmtest; makes it easy to find problems easier,
  rather than later.</para>

  <para>&qmtest; can be extended to handle any application domain and
  any test format.  &qmtest; works with existing testsuites, no matter
  how they work or how they are stored.  &qmtest;'s open and pluggable
  architecture supports a wide variety of applications.</para>

  <para>&qmtest; features both an intuitive graphical user interface
  and a conventional command-line interface.  &qmtest; can run tests
  in serial, in parallel on a single machine, or across a farm of
  possibly heterogeneous machines.</para>

  <para>CodeSourcery provides support for &qmtest;.  CodeSourcery can
  help you install, integrate, and customize &qmtest;.  For more
  information, visit <ulink
