 <title id="chap-iface-title">User Interface</title>

<section><title>Overview</title>

<para>&qmtest; will provide both a command-line and a graphical
interface.  The graphical user interface will provide a much more
sophisticated interface than that given by the command-line interface
described here.  The graphical user interface design will be completed
after more experience has been gained with &qmtest;.</para>

 <row>
  <entry>-c file file</entry> 
  <entry>Compare two sets of test results.</entry>

 <row>
  <entry>-d database</entry>
  <entry>Test database to use.  If not specified, use database
  specified in QMTEST_DATABASE environment variable (if it
  exists).</entry>
 </row>
 <row>
  <entry>-e</entry> 
  <entry>Report result of each test on a separate line.  By default,
  qmtest produces a one-line summary of results for all tests.</entry>
 </row>
 <row>
   <entry>-f test_filter</entry>
   <entry>Filter expression(s) to apply to tests.  Only tests that
    meet the filter criteria are executed.  If multiple test filters
    are provided, tests must satisfy all (implicit and).  If no
    filters are provided, all tests are run.  Note that allowing users
    to specify test IDs directly is redundant (since these are
    equivalent to "-t 'id==name'").  Direct test ID specification is
    provided for convenience.</entry>

 <row>
   <entry>-H hostfile</entry>
   <entry>Path to file containing names of remote hosts on which to

 <row>
  <entry>-r report_filter</entry>
  <entry>Filter expression(s) to apply to output.  Only test results
  that meet the filter criteria are included in the report.  If

  <entry>-s report_style</entry>
  <entry>Desired output format.  Options include "text" and "html".</entry>
 </row>
 <row>
  <entry>-t test_id+</entry>
  <entry>Test IDs of the tests of interest.  This
  option is strictly redundant (since tests can be selected using
  filters), but the "-t" option is provided as a convenience.</entry>

  <entry>-v [N]</entry>
  <entry>verbose (optionally to level N)</entry>
 </row>
 <row>
  <entry>-o file</entry>
  <entry>File in which to place XML representation of results.  If
  this option is not specified, then &qmtest; will use a filename
  based on the current time.</entry>
 </row>
 <row>
   <entry>-x file</entry>
   <entry>File containing expected outcomes.  The values provided in
   this file override those contained in the test specification
   itself.</entry>
 </row>
 <row>
   <entry>suites</entry>
   <entry>Name(s) of test suites from which to execute tests.  If no
   suite is specified, all tests in the database (that meet the filter 
   specifications given by <literal>-f</literal> and
