 <para><xref linkend="fig-cl-pdd"></xref> shows our current thoughts
 for the &M-PDD;.  It consists of representations of file system
 objects, both source and constructed.  It also contains some
 information regarding package options and distribution tags.  Not yet
 modelled is information for additional probes and platform-specific
 information.</para>

 <para>We have not settled on a final syntax for the &M-PDD;.  In some
 ways, this is less important than the object interfaces to this
 module.  Indeed, there is merit to having several possible syntaxes.
 A colleague who promotes &Q-LDAP; observes that &Q-LDAP; would allow
 the database to be distributed over multiple sites (and probably
 provide fast access).</para>
