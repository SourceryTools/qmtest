<chapter>
 <title>Issue Database Implementations</title>

 <para>In this chapter, we present two implementations of the
 &qmtrack; <link linkend="chap-idb-api">issue database</link>.
  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>The <link linkend="sec-xml-idb"
    endterm="sec-xml-idb-title"></link> section describes an &idb;
    which uses &xml; as its storage format.  Each issue is stored in
    an &xml;-formatted text file.</para>

    <para>This implementation provides the following benefits:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>Ease of implementation.  &xml; input and output code
       developed to implement the &xml; export functionality of
       &qmtrack; can be used immediately to read and write the
       issue.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>Editability.  Expert users can modify the &idb; directly
       by editing the &xml; issue files.  While we will in the long
       run discourage users from modifying the &idb; in this way, the
       ability to do so will be especially useful to &qmtrack;
       developers before the system is complete.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>Transparency.  It is conceivable that other tools will
       take advantage of a well-documented &xml; external format to
       manipulate the &idb; directly.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>No additional software requirements.  By including &xml;
       parsing and generating code directly in the &qmtrack;
       distribution, we will enable users to use this &idb;
       implementation "out of the box", without installing or
       configuring additional software.</para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>The <link linkend="sec-sql-idb"
    endterm="sec-sql-idb-title"></link> section describes an &idb;
    which uses an &sql; &rdbms; as its storage mechanism.  Each issue
    is represented by a rows in one or more tables.  The &sql;
    implementation relies on ordinary disk files as well for auxiliary
    storage, for such data as file attachment contents.</para>

    <para>The &sql; implementation provides the following advantages:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>Speed.  &rdbms;s are optimized for high-speed storage and
       retrieval of data.  A good &idb; implementation will take
       advantage of &rdbms; features such as indexing to speed up
       common operations.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>Scalability.  The efficiency and compactness of an
       &rdbms;'s data representation makes it suitable for very large
       deployments.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       <para>Integrity.  Most &rdbms; systems provide mechanisms to
       preserve the database integrity in such eventualities as sudden
       system failure.</para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>

   </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
 </para>

 <section id="sec-xml-idb">
  <title id="sec-xml-idb-title">&xml; issue database</title>

  <para>The &xml; &idb; implementation uses the canonical &xml;
  representation for issues described in section <link
  linkend="chap-xml-repr"
  endterm="chap-xml-repr-title"></link>.</para>

  <section>
   <title>Issue files</title>

   <para>Each issue is stored in a single &xml; file containing an
   <sgmltag>&lt;issue&gt;</sgmltag> element.  All revisions of the
   issue are included in this file.  The current revision is stored in
   full issue record format, with all fields included.  Previous
   revisions are stored as <link
   linkend="sec-diff-issue-records">difference issue
   records</link>.</para>
