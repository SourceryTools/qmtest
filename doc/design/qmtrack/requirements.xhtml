      <li>Modularity of user interfaces.  All features should be
      accessible via the web, e-mail, and the commend line.  Creation
      of other user interfaces should be possible via clear
      interfaces.</li>

      <li>Policy-neutrality.  The basic system architecture should
      make asolutely minimal assumptions about howhow the system will
      be used.</li>

      <li>Policy support.  Clear mechanisms will be provided for
      implementing and enforcing use policies.  Additionally,
      implementations of common policies will be provided as optional
      features.</li> 

      <li>Abstracted identity, authentication, and security.  Notions
      of user identity and mechanisms for authenticating users and
      securing communications will work through abstract interfaces.
      Implementations for typical use cases will be provided.</li>
