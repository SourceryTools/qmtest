  <title>Triggers</title>

  <para><firstterm id="def-trigger">Triggers</firstterm> provide a
  mechanism for extending a &qmtrack; issue database in two important
  ways.
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>A trigger can be used to impose a constraint on the issue
     database.  For instance, a trigger can check that a certain
     condition is fulfilled before allowing a modification to the
     issue database.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>A trigger can be used to implement issue database policies
     and workflow by invoking operations in response to user
     actions.</para>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
  </para>

  <para>A trigger is registered with the &idb; for one of three
  trigger types:
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>A <literal>"get"</literal> trigger is called before an
     issue is returned from a query or another issue retrieval
     operation.  The trigger may produce side effects related to the
     operation, such as gathering query statistics, or veto the
     operation, for instance to implement access control.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>A <literal>"preupdate"</literal> trigger is called before
     an update to an issue takes place.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>A <literal>"postupdate"</literal> trigger is called after
     an update to an issue takes place.</para>
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
  </para>
