  <title id="sec-ui-title">User Interface</title>

  <para>This section describes the different methods the user can use
  to create issues, edit issues, and query the database. We invision
  three main modes for interaction: command line, e-mail, and
  web. However, based on the &api; specification in <xref
  linkend="chap-implementation"/>, any mode may be added.</para>

  <section id="sec-command-line">
   <title id="sec-command-line-title">Command line</title>
   
   <para>All &qmtrack; command-line functionality is accessed via the
   &qmtrack-cmd; command, using a command-line syntax popularized by
   the <application>CVS</application> program.  The user provides a
   <firstterm id="def-subcommand">subcommand</firstterm> with each
   invocation of &qmtrack-cmd;, which specifies the type of operation
   to be performed.  The user may specify options modifying
   &qmtrack;'s behavior, and, for certain subcommands, additional
   arguments.</para>

   <synopsis>
    qmtrack [ options ] command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]
   </synopsis>

   <para>When creating or modifying an issue, field values are
   specified as arguments.  The user specifies field values to
   &qmtrack-cmd; commands using assignment notation, as in
   <userinput><replaceable>field</replaceable>=<replaceable>value</replaceable></userinput>.
   For set fields, different notation is used instead to add or remove
   elements from the set.  To add elements, the user specifies
   <userinput><replaceable>field</replaceable>+=<replaceable>value</replaceable></userinput>.
   To remove elements, the <userinput>-=</userinput> symbol is used
   instead.  All of the commands to create and edit issues use the
   above three operators to specify new values for fields.
   Alternately, the user may specify the issue to be created or edited
   in its &xml; form as described in Section <link
   linkend="sec-xml-repr" endterm="sec-xml-repr-title"/>.</para>
   <section id="sec-qmtrack-commands">
    <title id="sec-qmtrack-commands-title">&qmtrack-cmd commands</title>

    <formalpara>
     <title><command>create</command></title> 

     <para>This command is used to create a new issue.  It takes as
     its mandatory arguments a summary and categories.  Optional
     arguments include any other field values you wish to set.  For
     example,
     <screen>
      &prompt;<userinput>qmtrack create id="iss2" summary="My first issue" \
      categories+=simple categories+=first</userinput>
      <computeroutput>iss2</computeroutput>
     </screen>
     will create a new issue that has the summary, "My first issue"
     and belongs to the two categories, "simple" and "first". The
     value printed is the ID of the new issue.</para>
    </formalpara>

    <formalpara>
     <title><command>edit</command></title>

     <para>This command is used to edit an existing issue. It takes
     the ID of the command you wish to edit and then as arguments any
     fields you wish to edit. For example,
     <screen>
      &prompt;<userinput>qmtrack edit iss2 categories-=first</userinput>
      <computeroutput>iss2</computeroutput>
     </screen>
     will edit the issue with ID "iss2" removing the category "first"
     from the issue. A new revision of the issue will be created and
     stored in the database.  &qmtrack; responds with the issue ID of
     the edited issue.</para>
    </formalpara>

    <formalpara>
     <title><command>split</command></title>

     <para>The <command>split</command> command splits one issue into
     two.  The issue ids of the two new issues are printed (the old
     issue id is no longer used).  For example,
     <screen>
      &prompt;<userinput>qmtrack split foo</userinput>
      <computeroutput>foo.1, foo.2</computeroutput>
     </screen>
    </para>
    </formalpara>

    <formalpara>
     <title><command>join</command></title>

     <para>The <command>join</command> command joins two or more
     issues into a new issue.  If any field assignments are specified,
     these fields are modified in the newly-joined issue.  The issue
     id of the newly joined issue is printed.  For example,
     <screen>
      &prompt;<userinput>qmtrack join foo bar</userinput>
      <computeroutput>foo_bar</computeroutput>
     </screen>
    </para>
    </formalpara>

    <formalpara>
     <title><command>query</command></title>

     <para>This command is used to search the database for issues that
     match certain criteria.  A Python-like syntax is used to specify
     queries, as described in <link linkend="sec-queries"
     endterm="sec-queries-title"></link>.  For example,
     <screen>
      &prompt;<userinput> qmtrack query 'front_end in categories and severity &gt; serious'</userinput>
      <computeroutput>foo, bar, bar2, baz</computeroutput>
     </screen>
     searches for all issues in the category "front_end" at the
     severity level "serious" or greater.  &qmtrack; responds with the
     issue ids of matching issues.</para>
    </formalpara>

   </section>

   <section id="sec-output-options">
    <title id="sec-output-options-title">Output options</title>

    <para>By default, &qmtrack; displays a comma-separated list of
    issue IDs created, edited, or matched by the user's operation.
    Other output may be selected using the <option>--format</option>
    (<option>-f</option>) option.  This option takes an option
    parameter, which is the name of a format style.  See <xref
    linkend="tab-format-params"></xref> for parameter values.</para>

    <table id="tab-format-params">
     <title><option>--format</option> parameters</title>
     <tgroup cols="2">
      <thead>
       <row>
        <entry>format style</entry>
        <entry>description</entry>
       </row>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
       <row>
        <entry><literal>none</literal></entry>
        <entry>Don't display any issue output.</entry>

        <entry>The issue(s) in canonical &xml; format.</entry>
       </row>
      </tbody>
     </tgroup>
    </table>

    <para>Additionally, the <option>--custom-format</option>
    (<option>-F</option>) option may be used to specify a different
    format.  This option takes as its parameter a comma-separated list
    of field names to display in tabular format.</para>

   </section>

  </section>

  <section id="sec-email">
   <title id="sec-email-title">E-mail</title>

   <para>The e-mail interface uses the same syntax as the command-line
   interface for creating, editing, and querying issues.  A command is
   submitted in an e-mail message using the same syntax as the
   &qmtrack-cmd; command.  Alternately, the &xml; representation may
   be used for specifying new issues, issue modifications, or
   queries.</para>

   <para>For example, a new bug would be submitted with the e-mail
   message
    <programlisting>
Subject: create
To: qmtrack-database@domain.com
Date: Tue, 5 Dec 2000 23:42:15 -0800 (PST)

create summary="My issue" categories+=foo categories+=bar
    </programlisting>
   or, alternately, using the &xml; form,
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
Subject: create
To: qmtrack-database@domain.com
Date: Tue, 5 Dec 2000 23:42:15 -0800 (PST)

create
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE issue PUBLIC "-//Software Carpentry//DTD QMTrack V0.1//EN">
<issue>
 <field-data>
  <field name="summary">My issue</field>
  <field name="categories">
    <item>foo</item>
    <item>bar</item>
  </field>
 </field-data>
</issue>
    ]]></programlisting>
   &qmtrack; responds by sending the user an e-mail message
   summarizing the action:
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
Subject: Re: create
To: qmtrack-user@another-domain.com
Date: Tue, 5 Dec 2000 23:45:15 -0800 (PST)

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE issue PUBLIC "-//Software Carpentry//DTD QMTrack V0.1//EN">
<issue>
 <iid>iss2</iid>
 <field-data>
  <field name="summary">My issue</field>
  <field name="categories">
    <item>foo</item>
    <item>bar</item>
  </field>
 </field-data>
</issue>
    ]]></programlisting>
   indicating that the issue has been created.</para>

   <para>Similarly, editing an issue via e-mail can be performed using
   the command-line syntax or using &xml;.  In the latter case, a user
   may first request the &xml; representation from &qmtrack;, then
   edit it with her favorite text (or &xml;) editor, and mail it back.
   For example,
    <programlisting>
Subject: edit
To: qmtrack-database@domain.com
Date: Tue, 5 Dec 2000 23:42:15 -0800 (PST)

edit iss2
    </programlisting>
   with no arguments to the edit command gets back the response
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
Subject: Re: edit
To: qmtrack-user@another-domain.com
Date: Tue, 5 Dec 2000 23:45:15 -0800 (PST)

edit
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE issue PUBLIC "-//Software Carpentry//DTD QMTrack V0.1//EN">
<issue>
 <iid>iss2</iid>
 <field-data>
  <field name="summary">My issue</field>
  <field name="categories">
    <item>foo</item>
    <item>bar</item>
  </field>
 </field-data>
</issue>
    ]]></programlisting>
   The user may now edit this, for example by removing the line
   "<literal>&lt;item&gt;foo&lt;/item&gt;</literal>" to remove the
   issue from the "foo" category.  Sending this message back to
   &qmtrack; submits the issue modification:
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
Subject: Re: edit
To: qmtrack-database@domain.com
Date: Tue, 5 Dec 2000 23:42:15 -0800 (PST)

edit
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE issue PUBLIC "-//Software Carpentry//DTD QMTrack V0.1//EN">
<issue>
 <iid>iss2</iid>
 <field-data>
  <field name="summary">My issue</field>
  <field name="categories">
   <item>bar</item>
  </field>
 </field-data>
</issue>
    ]]></programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>Queries may also be requested from the issue database via
   e-mail.  Using the &xml; syntax instead of the command-line query
   syntax limits the flexibility of the search to a logical "and" of
   exact matches to issue fields.  For example, the
   following e-mail message to be sent to &qmtrack;,
    <programlisting><![CDATA[ 
Subject: query 
To: qmtrack-database@domain.com 
Date: Tue, 5 Dec 2000 23:42:15 -0800 (PST)

query
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE issue PUBLIC "-//Software Carpentry//DTD QMTrack V0.1//EN">
<issue>
 <field-data>
  <field name="categories">
   <item>bar</item>
  </field>
 </field-data>
</issue>
    ]]></programlisting>
   requests a query of all issues in category "bar".  &qmtrack; mails
   back the &xml; representation for any issues that have "bar" in
   their category set.  The equivalent e-mail query using the
   command-line syntax would be,
    <programlisting>
Subject: query
To: qmtrack-database@domain.com
Date: Tue, 5 Dec 2000 23:42:15 -0800 (PST)

query 'bar in categories'
    </programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>For more information about the query syntax that is allowed
   on the command line, see the section on <link linkend="sec-queries"
   endterm="sec-queries-title"></link>.</para>

  </section>

  <section id="sec-web-interface">
   <title>Web</title> 

   <para>To create, edit, and perform queries on the web, the user is
   presented with a form that displays controls corresponding to the
   fields of an issue.</para>

   <para><xref linkend="fig-web-state-model"/> shows the state model
   for the primary &qmtrack; web pages.  Each state represents a web
   page.  
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>The "New Issue Form" page displays controls for the fields
      in an issue, initially blank, to be filled out as a new issue
      entry.</para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>The "Edit Form" page displays the same form, but with
      the fields populated with the current field values from an
      existing issue.</para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>The "Query Form" page also displays a similar form, with
      the fields left blank; fields are filled in to specify the
      query.  The "Query Form" also contains a control that can be
      used to enter more complicated Python expression queries.</para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>The "View Issue" page shows the same form, but with
      non-editable controls displaying field values.  This page has a
      sub-state in which the audit trail (revision history) for the
      issue is also displayed.</para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>The "Issue List" page shows multiple issues resulting from
      a query in a summary format.  The page also contains query
      controls, by which the query results may be refined with
      additional restrictions.  This enables a "drill-down" model of
      browsing.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </para>

     <para>The figures shown here and below are still provisional.
     Layout, labelling, etc. will be refined based on additional GUI
     design work and usability testing.</para>
   </footnote>
   This is the control center for the database. From this menu, the user
   can access the forms necessary to create new issues, view existing
   issues, edit issues, query for issues, and perform advanced queries
   with a subset of the python expressions.</para>

   <figure id="fig-main1.jpg">
    <title>Main menu</title>

    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>On clicking the "Create" button of the "Main Menu" page, the user
   will be presented with the form shown in <xref
   linkend="fig-create-form"/>.</para>

   <figure id="fig-create-form">

      <imagedata fileref="create1.jpg" format="JPG" scale="50"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>This is the "New Issue" form described in the state model
   above.  In this form, the fields are to be displayed in a way that
   allows them to be edited.  This is one of the three methods of
   display.  The other two, as described below, are the displays for
   read-only fields and query fields.  Each field can be displayed in
   one of the three ways based upon the context of the page.  Once the
   user fills in the requisite information on the "New Issue" page and
   clicks the "Create" button, the user will be taken to a "View
   Issue" form that will show him the newly created issue.</para>

   <para><xref linkend="fig-view-form"/> shows the "View Issue" form
   that would be seen after creating a new issue.</para>

   <figure id="fig-view-form">
    <title>View Issue form</title>

     <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="create2.jpg" format="JPG" scale="50"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>The read-only form of the fields are used in this "View
   Issue" page.  None of the fields can be edited since this page is
   intended for display of issues only.  Also, the "View Issue" page
   allows more audit information to be displayed.</para>

   <para>The user has two ways of getting to the "Edit Issue" page
   described above in the state model. One way is for the user can
   simply click the "Edit" button on a "View Issue" page. The other
   way, the user simply enters the ID of the issue she wants to
   edit on the "Main Menu" page and then clicks "Edit" from
   there.  The user will be presented with the page shown in <xref
   linkend="fig-edit-form"/>. </para>

   <figure id="fig-edit-form">
    <title>Edit Issue form</title>
    <mediaobject>

      <imagedata fileref="edit1.jpg" format="JPG" scale="50"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>Then the user can then edit the issue on the page. Notice
   that the fields are displated in their edit form, just as they were
   on the "Create Issue" page. The user then clicks "Edit" to commit
   the changes he/she made. Again, a "View Issue" page will be
   displayed with the issue that was just edited.</para>

   <para>To perform queries, the user may either enter the Python
   expression query string on the "Main Menu" page described above, or
   click the "Query" button on that page. In the latter case, the
   "Query Form" shown in <xref linkend="fig-query-form"/> is
   displayed.</para>

   <figure id="fig-query-form">
    <title>Query form</title>
    <mediaobject>
     <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="query1.jpg" format="JPG" scale="50"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>Then the user can simply put values in the fields as desired,
   choosing how to search on each field with the given pull down
   menus.  This page shows the third type of display for fields, the
   query display.  For queries, it is not sufficient to simply have an
   edit box for each field.  Each field must accompanied by some
   options for how to query on that field.  For example, for queries
   on integer fields, the user may wish to specify "less than,"
   "greater than," or "exact" searches on that field.  Therefore, drop
   lists are used to allow select the type query on each field.</para>

   <para>After clicking the "Query" button, the page shown in <xref
   linkend="fig-query-results"/> displays the query results.</para>

   <figure id="fig-query-results">
    <title>Query Results page</title>
    <mediaobject>
     <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="query3.jpg" format="JPG" scale="50"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>This corresponds to the "Issue List" shown in the state
   model.  It displays a list of issues that matched the criteria
   specified in the query (either an "Advanced Query" or "Basic
   Query").  From this page, the user may refine his search by
   clicking the "Refine Query" button.  This will return the user to
   the "Query Form" page to enter additional information.  The query
   will then be performed only on the issues in the issue list.  The
   user may view (and subsequently edit) an individual issue in the
   issue list by clicking on its issue ID, which takes the user to a
   "View Issue" page for that issue.</para>
