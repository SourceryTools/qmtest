    <title>qmtrack Terminology</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <ul>
      <li><a class="TermDef">issue</a>: A record in the qmtrack system
      is called an issue.  We choose a general and neutral term, since
      issues may correspond not only to bug reports, but to feature
      requests, documentation errors, or other, unforseen items.</li>

      <li><a class="TermDef">issue database</a> (<a
      class="TermDef">idb</a>): An instance of qmtrack stores all
      issues in a single issue database.</li>

      <li><a class="TermDef">issue id</a> (<a
      class="TermDef">iid</a>): Each issue is assigned a issue id
      unique to the issue database.  An issue id is a nonnegative
      31-bit integer (the nonnegative range of a standard Python
      integer).</li>

      <li><a class="TermDef">category</a>: Categories are the
      mechanism by which issues are combined into sets.  Categories
      are primarily an organizational tool.  Each issue may belong to
      zero or more categories.  Categories are referred to by short
      text strings.  The set of categories is enumerated as part of
      the <a class="Term">idb</a> configuration; an issue may belong
      to any subset of these categories.</li>

    </ul>
