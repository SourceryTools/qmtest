 <section id="sec-xml-repr">
  <title id="sec-xml-repr-title">&xml; Representation</title>

  <para>Issues may be represented in &xml;, both in the inner workings
  of an &idb; implementation, and in user-visible output.  The latter
  includes exported &xml; and use of &xml; in user interfaces, such as
  in the <link linkend="sec-email">e-mail interface</link>.</para>

  <section id="sec-issue-dtd">
   <title id="sec-issue-dtd-title">Issue &dtd;</title>

   <para>This &dtd; is the canonical representation for &qmtrack;
   issues in &xml;.  While &idb; implementations may choose a
   different &dtd; for their internal storage mechanism, issues should
   be represented according to this &dtd; for all user-visible &xml;
   output.</para>

   <programlisting><![CDATA[
<!ELEMENT issue (class, iid, field-data*)>

<!ELEMENT field-data (field*)>
<!ATTLIST field-data revision-number CDATA #OPTIONAL>

<!ELEMENT class (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT iid (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT field (#PCDATA | attachment | item*)>
<!ATTLIST field name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!ELEMENT item (#PCDATA | attachment)>

<!ELEMENT attachment (description mime-type external-name)>

<!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT mime-type (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT external-name (#PCDATA)>
]]></programlisting>

   <para>The formal public identifier for this &dtd; is
    <programlisting>
     "-//Software Carpentry//DTD QMTrack V0.1//EN"
    </programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>&xml; representations of an issue will normally present a
   single revision only, namely the latest revision.  In this case,
   the <sgmltag>&lt;issue&gt;</sgmltag> element will contain only a
   single <sgmltag>&lt;field-data&gt;</sgmltag> element, and the the
   <property>revision-numer</property> attribute is supressed.  For
   &xml;-based &idb; implementations in which multiple revisions are
   stored together, multiple <sgmltag>&lt;field-data&gt;</sgmltag>
   elements will be included with different
   <property>revision-numer</property> values.  The &idb;
   implementation may choose to store <link
   linkend="sec-diff-issue-records">difference issue records</link>
   instead of the entire field data for past revision, i.e. for the
   next-most-recent and previous revisions, only fields that were
   changes are included in the <sgmltag>&lt;field-data&gt;</sgmltag>
   element.</para>

   <para>The <sgmltag>&lt;field&gt;</sgmltag> element is used for all
   issue fields.  For set fields, the contents are zero or more item
   tags, each corresponding to an element of the set.  For attachment
   fields, the contents are an <sgmltag>&lt;attachment&gt;</sgmltag>
   element.  Other field types are represented with CDATA.</para>

   <para>The second component of the
   <sgmltag>&lt;attachment&gt;</sgmltag> element is the attachment's
   MIME type.  The third component,
   <sgmltag>&lt;external-name&gt;</sgmltag>, is a file name or other
   identifier for the location of the attachment data.  For disk-based
   &idb; implementations, it will contain a relative path to a file.
   For e-mail &xml; issue representations, it will contain the name of
   a MIME attachment included in the e-mail message.</para>

   <title>&xml; example</title>

   <para>Below is an example of an issue for a compiler bug report.
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE issue PUBLIC "-//Software Carpentry//DTD QMTrack V0.1//EN">
<issue>
  <class>bug</class>
  <iid>17</iid>
  <field-data>
    <field name="categories">
      <item>front end</item>
      <item>C++</item>
    </field>
    <field name="severity">severe</field>
    <field name="priority">4</field>
    <field name="description">"Internal Compiler Error" in parser.</field>
    <field name="input">
<![CDATA[
int foo (char* p) {
  return *p = *(++p);
}
]]>]]&gt;<![CDATA[
    </field>
    <field name="flags">-g -O2</field>
    <field name="attachments">
      <item>
        <attachment>
          <description>core file</description>
          <mime-type>application/octet-stream</mime-type>
          <external-name>attachment001</external-name>
        </attachment>
      </item>
    </field>
  </field-data>
</issue>
    ]]></programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>This example is an issue in the issue class "bug", which is
   used for bug reports (as opposed to, for instance, feature requests
   or reports of documentation errors).  The issue id is "17", and the
   issue is included in two categories: "back end" and "C++".</para>

   <para>In addition to the standard "severity", "priority", and
   "description" fields, the "bug" issue class includes two other
   fields specifically added for recording information about compiler
   bugs.  The "flags" field describes the command-line options that
   should be specified when inoking the compiler to reproduce the
   problem.  The "input" field contains the input source code.  Since
   the "input" field contains program text that is likely to contain
   special characters, the field contents are placed in a
   <sgmltag>CDATA</sgmltag> element.</para>

   <para>The "attachment" field in the "bug" issue class contains a
   set of zero or more file attachments.  For this bug, one attachment
   is included: a core file generated by the crashing compiler.  The
   MIME type is "application/octet-stream", since core files are
   usually treated as binary data.  The data itself is stored in an
   object named "attachment001".  The location of this object is
   context-dependent; if the &xml; issue record is in the &idb;, it is
   stored in a file by that name, while if the issue record is
   included in an e-mail message, it will be included as an attachment
   with that name.</para>
