This file describes user visible changes to QM.

QM 1.1.4
========

The QMTest GUI no longer crashes when the "Cancel" button is hit when
creating a new test suite.

Commands like "qmtest create-tdb --attribute X=Y" where "Y" contains
spaces are now handled correctly.

QM 1.1.3
========

The "-c" option to "qmtest run" did not work correctly in QM 1.1.2.
This problem has been corrected.

QM 1.1.2
========

QM is now licensed under the GNU General Public License.

The QMTest GUI has been substantially improved.

It is now possible to load and save the context in the GUI.

Numerous small bugs have been fixed.

QM 1.1
======

QMTest now works on systems that do not have support for threads, or,
more precisely, when using a Python interpreter for which "import
thread" fails.

The Makefiles and build tree have been reorganized so as to make
installation from source simpler.

QMTest should now build on Debian GNU/Linux without configure options.
