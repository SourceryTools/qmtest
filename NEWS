This file describes user visible changes to QM.

QM 2.1 (Not Yet Released)
=========================

QM 2.1 requires Python 2.2 or greater.

There is now a "qmtest create" command-line option that can be used to
create extension instances (such as tests, resources, or databases)
programmatically.  The "--class" option to the qmtest create-tdb"
command now supports the same descriptor syntax as "qmtest create".

There is a new executable.TimeoutExecutable class that can be used to
run a child process with a timeout.  The "command" test classes now
make use of this functionality to support running child processes with
a timeout.

There is now a "-O" or "--outcomes" option for setting the expected
outcomes, even when working within in the GUI.

There is a new "--result-stream" option to "qmtest run" and "qmtest
summarize" that allows users to specify custom result streams.

A defect that could cause a multi-threaded or multi-process tests run
to hang if a resource could not be set up has been corrected.

QM 2.0.4 (Not Yet Released)
===========================

A defect that could cause crashes in the RSHTarget class has been
corrected.

QM 2.0.3
========

A JavaScript issue that prevented the pop-up menus in the GUI from
working correctly with Mozilla 1.0.1 was corrected.

A bug that could cause QMTest to hang when running tests in parallel
has been corrected.

QM 2.0.2
========

When a test fails due to dependency on a resource that could not be
set up, the GUI now displays a link to the resource result from the
test result.  (Previously, there was no way to get information about
resource failures in the GUI.)

The GUI now offers a choice of available prerequisite tests and
resources when editing a test.

The substitutions field for the FileContentsTest now works correctly
in the GUI.  This is an incompatible change; tests that use this test
class will require hand-editing.

An argument in a derived test or resource class which has the same
name as an argument in a base class now overrides the base class
argument.  Therefore, every test class will have only one argument
with a given name.  (Previously, both the base and derived class
arguments were present.)

QM 2.0.1
========

A bug that prevented the "New Resource" entry on the "File" menu from
working has been fixed.

QM 2.0
======

Netscape 4 is no longer supported by the QMTest GUI.  Mozilla 1.x and
Internet Explorer 6 are the recommended browsers for use with the
QMTest GUI.  On UNIX-like systems, QMTest will now try to run
"mozilla", rather than "netscape", by default.

Tests are no longer run in a random order by default.  To run tests in
a random order, you must now use the "--random" option to "qmtest run".

QMTest now has a "ProcessTarget" target class that can be used to
run tests in parallel on systems that do not support threads.

QMTest now requires that all extension classes be listed in the
classes.qmc file in the directory that contains the extension class.

QMTest now uses a uniform XML file format for all extension classes,
including tests, resources, databases, and targets.  This format will
remain stable for the forseeable future.  While QMTest 2.0 can read
the formats created by previous versions of QMTest, it will only write
files in the new format.  Most users will be unaffected by these
changes.

New command-line options:
-------------------------

QMTest now has a "--version" option.

The "qmtest run" command now has a "--rerun" option to rerun only
those tests which had unexpected outcomes when the tests were last
run.

The "qmtest run" command now has a "--random" option to run the tests in 
a random order.

The "qmtest extensions" command can be used to list the available
extension classes.

The "qmtest register" command can be used to register new extension 
classes and to try loading an extension class.

The "qmtest help" command is a synonym for "qmtest --help".

The "qmtest run" and "qmtest gui" commands now use a file named
"context" in the current directory as a context file if no explict -C
option is provided.

QM 1.1.5
========

When loading a test, resource, or database class, the directory
containing the extension class is placed at the front of the path used
to search for modules.  In previous versions of QMTest, it was placed
at the back.

QM 1.1.4
========

The QMTest GUI no longer crashes when the "Cancel" button is hit when
creating a new test suite.

Commands like "qmtest create-tdb --attribute X=Y" where "Y" contains
spaces are now handled correctly.

QM 1.1.3
========

The "-c" option to "qmtest run" did not work correctly in QM 1.1.2.
This problem has been corrected.

QM 1.1.2
========

QM is now licensed under the GNU General Public License.

The QMTest GUI has been substantially improved.

It is now possible to load and save the context in the GUI.

Numerous small bugs have been fixed.

QM 1.1
======

QMTest now works on systems that do not have support for threads, or,
more precisely, when using a Python interpreter for which "import
thread" fails.

The Makefiles and build tree have been reorganized so as to make
installation from source simpler.

QMTest should now build on Debian GNU/Linux without configure options.
