============================
zope.formlib support in Five
============================

Five supports zope.formlib, an alternative for constructing add, edit, and
other forms based on schema. See zope/formlib/form.txt for a thorough
description of the functionality provided by formlib.

Formlib forms are normal view classes, registered as browser pages. Where
in a pure Zope-3 context you would derive from one of the zope.formlib.form
baseclasses, you now need to derive from one of the baseclasses provided by
Products.Five.formlib.formbase.

In almost all cases you need to import from zope.formlib.from as well -
e.g. Fields and Actions in order to define and select fields and to add
actions to your form.

See Products.Five.formlib.tests for a minimal example.

Note:
-----

Currently zope.formlib.page and zope.formlib.namedtemplate are not
supported in Five.
