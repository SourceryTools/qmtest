v1.4
----

- fix up locale support in Five.form/Five.formlib

- l10n (philikon)

- Figure out where add-view redirects should go.

- Instructions on using add views.

- HTTP/WebDAV: support dispatching of all HTTP/WebDAV methods to HTTP
  views.  If lookup fails, fall back to methods on the object (Zope 2
  style).  Security is implied by HTTP views.

- FTP: allow manage_FTPstat, manage_FTPget, manage_FTPlist to dispatch to
  filerepresentation adapters.  Make sure to handle security correctly.

- Grant security stuff through ZCML (<grant />)?

- top-level <require />, <allow /> directives as a ZCML spelling of
  allowModule, allowClass

* marker interfaces

  - re-add 'views_details' that didn't make it into 1.2/1.3

  - add interface for ordering marker interfaces

  - improve the way available marker interfaces are detected. It should be
    possible to declare interfaces explicitly as marker interfaces.
