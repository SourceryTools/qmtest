Description: ZConfig is a configuration library intended for general use.  It
        supports a hierarchical schema-driven configuration model that allows
        a schema to specify data conversion routines written in Python.
        ZConfig's model is very different from the model supported by the
        ConfigParser module found in Python's standard library, and is more
        suitable to configuration-intensive applications.
        
        ZConfig schema are written in an XML-based language and are able to
        "import" schema components provided by Python packages.  Since
        components are able to bind to conversion functions provided by Python
        code in the package (or elsewhere), configuration objects can be
        arbitrarily complex, with values that have been verified against
        arbitrary constraints.  This makes it easy for applications to
        separate configuration support from configuration loading even with
        configuration data being defined and consumed by a wide range of
        separate packages.
