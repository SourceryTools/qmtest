Logout Support
==============

Logout support is defined by a simple interface ILogout:

  >>> from zope.app.security.interfaces import ILogout

that has a single 'logout' method.

The current use of ILogout is to adapt an IAuthentication component to ILogout
To illustrate, we'll create a simple logout implementation that adapts
IAuthentication:

  >>> class SimpleLogout(object):
  ...
  ...     adapts(IAuthentication)
  ...     implements(ILogout)
  ...
  ...     def __init__(self, auth):
  ...         pass
  ...
  ...     def logout(self, request):
  ...         print 'User has logged out'

  >>> provideAdapter(SimpleLogout)

and something to represent an authentication utility:

  >>> class Authentication(object):
  ...
  ...     implements(IAuthentication)

  >>> auth = Authentication()

To perform a logout, we adapt auth to ILogout and call 'logout':

  >>> logout = ILogout(auth)
  >>> logout.logout(TestRequest())
  User has logged out


The 'NoLogout' Adapter
----------------------

The class:

  >>> from zope.app.security import NoLogout

can be registered as a fallback provider of ILogout for IAuthentication
components that are not otherwise adaptable to ILogout. NoLogout's logout
method is a no-op:

  >>> NoLogout(auth).logout(TestRequest())


Logout User Interface
---------------------

Because some authentication protocols do not formally support logout, it may
not be possible for a user to logout once he or she has logged in. In such
cases, it would be inappropriate to present a user interface for logging out.

Because logout support is site-configurable, Zope provides an adapter that,
when registered, indicates that the site is configured for logout:

  >>> from zope.app.security import LogoutSupported

This class merely serves as a flag as it implements ILogoutSupported:

  >>> from zope.app.security.interfaces import ILogoutSupported
  >>> ILogoutSupported.implementedBy(LogoutSupported)
  True
