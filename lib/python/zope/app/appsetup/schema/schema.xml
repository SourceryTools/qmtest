    <!-- Poor name inherited from Zope 2.
         This can't be changed since components refer to this in a
         similar way as to public base classes.  Components that want
         to work with both Zope 2 and Zope 3 need this to match the
         existing Zope 2 name.

    <description>
      Base type for component-specific configuration sections.

      Specific products should implement configuration sections by
      defining sections types that implement this abstract type and
      using their own schema component to define meaningful settings.

      Component-specific configuration stanzas.

      Products may use the &lt;product-config&gt; section type, or may supply
      a component.xml which defines section types with their own schemas.

      All sections for this multisection will be collected together into the
      'product_config' attribute of the configuration object.

      Application database.

      At least one database must be specified.  The first will be used
      as the main database.  At most one of the databases can be unnamed.

      All of the databases specified will be part of a multi-database.
      See the ZODB documentation of multi-databases for details of how
      this is useful.

      This specifies additional paths directories which are inserted into
      the beginning of Python's module search path.  The set of directories
      specified is inserted into the beginning of the module search path in
      the order which they are specified here.  Note that the processing of
      this directive may happen too late under some circumstances; it is
      recommended that you use the PYTHONPATH environment variable if
      using this directive doesn't work for you.
