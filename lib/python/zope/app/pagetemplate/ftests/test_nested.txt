Macro extension
===============

This test demonstrates how macro extension allows a macro to extend
and re-offer a slot for a client template to fill.  This is likely not
the best place for this test, but it demonstrates how to use the macro
extension feature in context.

Let's look at our test view using the root folder to make sure we're
seeing the expected template expansion::

  >>> print http("""
  ... GET /@@inner HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic mgr:mgrpw
  ... """, handle_errors=False)
  HTTP/1.1 200 ...
  <BLANKLINE>
  <html>
  <head>
  <title>Example: outer</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  hello
  <div>
  <div>
  inner body slot content
  </div>
  intermediate body slot stuff
  </div>
  </body>
  </html>
  <BLANKLINE>
