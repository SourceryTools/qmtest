The containerViews directive lets us associate some standard forms
for containers with an interface.  There's an "index.html" view that
provides a listing of the contained objects without provinding any way
to manage them (though it allows us to visit them by clicking on
links).

We can get this view from the root folder easily::

  >>> response = http(r"""
  ... GET / HTTP/1.1
  ... """)

And we can check that there isn't a form (where the management
operations would have buttons)::

  >>> body = response.getBody().lower()
  >>> "<form" in body
  False
