------------------------------

- Moved to `zope.app.tree`

- It is now called 'ZopeTree' again.  Hoorray!

- Refactored browser stuff into its own browser subpackage.

  to provide a base class for views based on other tree state sources.

v1.1 (2004-02-16) -- 'Zapp'
---------------------------

- Added support for displaying lines in a tree (Stephan Richter)

    third party templates from 1.0.x will not work anymore and must be
    updated as well!
