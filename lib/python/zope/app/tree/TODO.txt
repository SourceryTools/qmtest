for v1.3

- allow sorting: would work similar to filter

- add XML representation so it's compatible with rotterdam's
  xmltree.js, but stateful

Done for z3 release 3.1
-----------------------

- Catch Unauthorized exception and don't add items we don't have permission
  for accessing. This makes it possible to use the cookie tree without 
  zope.ManageSite permission. Right now the cookie tree access the ++etc++site
  as default and raise a Unauthorized exception.
