Passing arguments explicitly
============================

In most of the examples here, we set up `sys.argv`.  In normal usage,
the testrunner just uses `sys.argv`.  It is possible to pass arguments
explicitly.

    >>> import os.path
    >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', directory_with_tests,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^sampletestsf?$',
    ...     ]
    >>> from zope.testing import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run(defaults, 'test --layer 111'.split())
    Running samplelayers.Layer111 tests:
      Set up samplelayers.Layerx in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up samplelayers.Layer1 in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up samplelayers.Layer11 in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up samplelayers.Layer111 in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 34 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer111 in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down samplelayers.Layerx in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer11 in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer1 in N.NNN seconds.
    False
