    This interface provides methods for translating text, including text with

    When we refer to text here, we mean text that follows the standard Zope 3
    text representation.

    The domain is used to specify which translation to use.  Different
    products will often use a specific domain naming translations supplied
    with the product.

    A favorite example is: How do you translate 'Sun'? Is it our star, the
    abbreviation of Sunday or the company?  Specifying the domain, such as
    'Stars' or 'DaysOfWeek' will solve this problem for us.

    Standard arguments in the methods described below:

        msgid -- The id of the message that should be translated.  This may be
                 an implicit or an explicit message id.

        mapping -- The object to get the interpolation data from.

        target_language -- The language to translate to.

        context -- An object that provides contextual information for
                   determining client language preferences.  It must implement
                   or have an adapter that implements IUserPreferredLanguages.
                   It will be to determine the language to translate to if
                   target_language is not specified explicitly.
