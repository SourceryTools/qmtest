Resolution of dotted names
==========================

The zope.dottedname.resolve module provides a function for resolving
dotted names.  Dotted names are resolved by importing modules and by
getting attributes from imported modules.  Names with leading dots are
relative.

To illustrate, we'll use the dotted name resolver to access objects in
the os module:

    >>> from zope.dottedname.resolve import resolve
    >>> resolve('os.path.split').__name__
    'split'

Here, we used an absolute name.  We can also using a relative name:

    >>> resolve('.split').__name__
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: relative name without base module

But we need to provide the module the name is relative to:

    >>> resolve('.split', 'os.path').__name__
    'split'

    >>> resolve('..system', 'os.path').__name__
    'system'

    >>> resolve('...datetime', 'os.path').__name__
    'datetime'
